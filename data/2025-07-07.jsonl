Central to this approach is\na generative mechanism that creates \\emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem\ninstances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \\emph{soft constraints}\nand unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing\nmeta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and\ncompared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design\nprinciples for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may\nunderpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,\ninstructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general\nartificial intelligence."}

GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning.
