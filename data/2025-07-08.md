Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

### [2] [Learning to Generate Vectorized Maps at Intersections with Multiple Roadside Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02899)
*Miao Fan,Quanxin Zheng,Shengtong Xu,Linghe Kong,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRC-VMap是一种基于视觉的端到端神经网络，用于从多方向摄像头图像直接生成高清矢量地图，降低了成本并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统离线方法成本高、在线方法性能有限的问题，特别是复杂交叉路口的矢量地图生成。

Method: 利用现有路边监控摄像头，将时间对齐的多方向图像直接转换为矢量地图，减少中间模块和计算开销。

Result: 在4000个交叉路口的实验中，性能优于现有在线方法，接近高成本激光雷达方法的精度。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap为自动驾驶导航提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用视频数据的伪标签框架，用于单目3D目标检测，无需多视角设置或额外传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D目标检测中数据稀缺和2D到3D模糊性问题，避免依赖领域特定学习或单一观测形状信息。

Method: 通过对象点跟踪聚合静态和动态物体的伪LiDAR数据，提取3D属性。

Result: 实验表明该方法具有高准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

Method: 评估MLLMs在分类网球动作和识别动作序列中的能力，并探索通过不同训练方法及与传统模型结合提升性能。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，需进一步优化训练方法以提升性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical
analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic modelling in professional
tennis.

TL;DR: 利用街景图像建模食物不安全问题，提出特征提取和门控注意力聚合的两步方法，虽预测能力略逊，但可作为现有方法的补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物不安全是城市公共卫生问题，现有调查方法难以扩展，需探索新方法。

Method: 采用两步法：特征提取和门控注意力图像聚合。

Result: 模型预测能力略逊于其他架构，但权重解释和案例研究显示潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法有望为城市规划和政策制定者补充现有食物不安全识别方法。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

### [8] [SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04285)
*Ze Yuan,Xin Yu,Yangtian Sun,Yuan-Chen Guo,Yan-Pei Cao,Ding Liang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqTex是一个端到端的框架，利用预训练视频基础模型的视觉知识直接生成完整的UV纹理贴图，避免了传统两阶段方法的误差累积和空间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模高质量的3D纹理数据集，现有方法通常依赖于对基础图像生成模型进行微调，但这种方法只能生成多视角图像并需要后处理，导致误差累积和空间不一致。

Method: SeqTex将任务重新定义为序列生成问题，学习多视角渲染和UV纹理的联合分布，并提出了解耦的多视角和UV分支设计、几何感知注意力机制和自适应令牌分辨率等创新架构。

Result: SeqTex在图像条件和文本条件的3D纹理生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，具有更好的3D一致性、纹理-几何对齐和真实世界泛化能力。

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端框架直接生成UV纹理贴图，显著提升了3D纹理生成的性能和质量。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

TL;DR: OBSER框架通过贝叶斯方法推断子环境与对象的关系，利用度量学习和自监督学习在潜在空间估计对象分布，并引入EDS函数验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放世界和逼真环境中子环境与对象关系的推断问题，实现自主环境理解。

Method: 结合度量学习和自监督学习，在潜在空间估计对象分布，并通过EDS函数验证表示对齐。

Result: 在开放世界和逼真环境中可靠推断，且在链式检索任务中优于基于场景的方法。

Conclusion: OBSER框架实现了零样本环境识别，为自主环境理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏瓦片的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏内容与叙事不一致的问题，以及训练数据风格分布不均导致的视觉多样性限制。

Method: 收集艺术家创作的游戏瓦片，提供语义标注，并开发低分辨率瓦片对象检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的游戏内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法、丰富游戏叙事的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

*Chenglin Li,Qianglong Chen,fengtao,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的无训练框架，通过迭代调整时间关注区域，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间关注区域解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两个迭代阶段实现：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间中采样固定数量帧，生成细化响应和置信度分数。此外，引入TS-BFS策略优化搜索效率。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间关注区域，显著提升了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，同时降低了内存消耗。

Conclusion: TS为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，未来可进一步优化其搜索策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶在长尾场景中因动态环境不确定性和数据覆盖不足，难以准确预测未来运动安全性。

Method: 引入基于BEV的运动模拟方法合成高风险数据DriveMRP-10K，并设计VLM无关的DriveMRP-Agent框架，结合全局上下文、自车视角和轨迹投影。

Result: 实验显示DriveMRP-Agent显著提升VLM性能，事故识别准确率从27.13%提升至88.03%，零样本测试中从29.42%提升至68.50%。

Conclusion: DriveMRP-Agent框架通过合成数据训练和全局信息注入，显著提升了VLM的运动风险预测能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于红外热像仪（IRT）的发热筛查方法，通过多模态配准技术精确定位眼角区域，以提高发热检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传染病大流行期间，如埃博拉和SARS，快速、非侵入性的发热筛查方法至关重要。红外热像仪因其高效性被广泛应用于公共场所的温度监测，但需要精确定位眼角区域以提高准确性。

Method: 采用粗-精配准策略，结合基于标志点和眼轮廓边缘检测的不同配准模型，实现红外和白光图像的多模态配准。

Result: 配准精度在2.7毫米以内，能够精确定位眼角区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了一种高精度的解决方案，适用于公共场所的温度监测。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Preethi Raju,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSAT的新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知技术降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉-语言模型（vLLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决vLLMs中标准注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，尤其是在跨模态计算时的高内存和延迟成本。

Method: 采用压缩感知技术，将高维键值表示投影到低维子空间，并通过稀疏恢复算法重建注意力输出。

Result: CSAT显著降低了注意力复杂度，同时保持了语义保真度，在标准基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: CSAT是一种可扩展、可解释且资源高效的多模态Transformer解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Result: 在原始测试图像上mAP达98.9%，视角偏移测试图像上mAP达94.7%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VR-YOLO在保持低计算成本的同时，显著提升了PCB缺陷检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear

*Andi Zhang,Xuan Ding,Steven McDonagh,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过概率视角生成多样化的对抗样本，同时保留原始概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击局限于单图像扰动，缺乏多样性和概念保留能力。

Method: 利用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样对抗样本，保持原始概念。

Result: 生成的对抗样本更具多样性且保留概念，攻击效率更高。

Conclusion: 概念对抗攻击框架在多样性和概念保留上优于传统方法。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Result: YOLOv11在整体性能上优于YOLOv8。

Conclusion: AI技术（尤其是YOLOv11）可有效提升低能见度水下管道检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater
environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion,
and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail
to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection
in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline
structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a
comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating
target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，用于在印度全国范围内实现农场级别的多作物识别，解决了现有方法在地理可扩展性、作物类型覆盖和季节性识别方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的农场级别作物类型信息对国家粮食安全、农业政策制定和经济规划至关重要，尤其是在印度这样的农业大国。现有方法在可扩展性、作物覆盖和季节性识别方面存在不足。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星图像与全国农场边界数据，利用深度学习模型识别12种主要作物，并开发了自动季节检测算法。

Result: 模型在冬季和季风季节的识别准确率分别为94%和75%，并能在生长季节早期（两个月内）提供可靠的作物识别。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了印度全国范围内的农场级别季节性作物识别，验证了其有效性和可扩展性，为农业监测和管理提供了数据驱动的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Motivation: 探索AI在重现或重新想象圣经叙事中的潜力，以及其在神圣艺术中的角色和局限性。

Method: 使用MidJourney生成图像，结合Google图像和古典绘画进行视觉比较分析。

Result: AI能生成美学丰富的图像，但反映训练数据的偏见，缺乏真正的创造性和神学深度。

Conclusion: AI可作为圣经文本重新解读的创意伙伴，但其在神圣艺术中的作用仍复杂且有争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型（VLMs）在空间变形推理任务中的表现，发现现有模型在此类任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型是否真正具备空间推理能力，尤其是从2D到3D的空间变形推理。

Method: 构建了一个空间变形推理的基准测试，通过数据引擎生成无限的问题对，并采用阶梯式竞赛形式评估模型的正向和反向推理能力。

Result: 几乎所有模型在空间变形推理任务中表现不佳，即使经过针对性训练和主流推理增强方法，仍无法有效完成3D空间变形推理。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型在空间变形推理方面存在明显不足，需要进一步研究提升其能力。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集常存在噪声、错误标签或泛化性差的图像，且样本量小易导致过拟合，可能对诊断准确性造成严重影响。

Method: 提出IMET框架，结合课程学习和核心集选择，通过迭代识别误分类样本优化训练，重点关注边缘案例和罕见结果。

Result: 在基准医学图像分类数据集上评估IMET，结果显示其能提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种有效的数据高效训练策略，尤其在处理边缘案例和罕见结果时表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中深度融合与计算可扩展性之间的矛盾。

Method: 采用循环管道处理多模态数据，通过Transformer解码器层进行对称交叉注意力，并使用门控融合单元动态控制信息流。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中表现接近复杂基线，嵌入空间可视化显示其能生成结构化的类别可分表示。

Conclusion: GRF为高效、强大的多模态表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Motivation: 医学AI系统需要数据高效且领域感知的预训练策略，但临床数据集（如MIMIC-CXR）图像数量有限且标注稀缺。

Method: 将成对的胸部X光片（正面和侧面视图）作为自然正对，学习从稀疏补丁重建视图并对其潜在嵌入进行对齐。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR上表现优于监督目标和未利用结构的基线方法。

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了轻量级、模态无关的蓝图。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than
existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic
images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised
frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and

Motivation: 早期脊柱侧弯难以检测，传统X射线方法有辐射风险且依赖专家经验，需要一种非侵入性、可大规模筛查的解决方案。

Result: 在Scoliosis1K数据集上表现优异，尤其在处理类别不平衡和检测边缘案例方面。

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为非侵入性脊柱侧弯检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Result: XGBoost在二分类和多分类任务中表现最佳，HOG和TDA准确率相近（二分类约94%，多分类约74%）。

Conclusion: HOG和TDA在视网膜图像分类中性能相当但捕捉不同特征，适用于其他医学图像领域并可集成到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型在多模态基准测试中的推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备视觉融合推理的内在能力，Look-Back方法无需显式约束即可提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue
in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our
standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy
and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time
digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative
method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology,
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology
(SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time
microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images
of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic
analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review
the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for rail line detection and the
identification of human beings in proximity to the track, utilizing the YOLOv5
deep learning model to mitigate potential accidents. The technique incorporates
real-time video data to identify railway tracks with impressive accuracy and
recognizes nearby moving objects within a one-meter range, specifically
targeting the identification of humans. This system aims to enhance safety
measures in railway environments by providing real-time alerts for any detected
human presence close to the track. The integration of a functionality to
identify objects at a longer distance further fortifies the preventative
capabilities of the system. With a precise focus on real-time object detection,
this method is poised to deliver significant contributions to the existing
technologies in railway safety. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation, yielding a remarkable
improvement in accuracy over existing methods. These results underscore the
potential of this approach to revolutionize safety measures in railway
environments, providing a substantial contribution to accident prevention

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于扩散的图像生成器快速发展，区分生成图像与真实图像变得困难，亟需开发通用性强的检测器。

Method: LATTE通过建模潜在嵌入在多步去噪过程中的轨迹，结合潜在-视觉特征细化模块和轻量级分类器，实现高效检测。

Result: LATTE在多个基准测试（如GenImage和DiffusionFake）上超越基线方法，并在跨生成器和跨数据集场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: LATTE展示了潜在轨迹嵌入在生成图像检测中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种心理学分类法，用于分析视觉语言模型（VLMs）的幻觉行为，包括奉承、逻辑不一致和新发现的权威偏见，并通过AIpsych基准揭示了模型行为与心理学偏见的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将幻觉归因于技术限制或奉承偏见，而忽略了其可能反映人类心理学中的认知偏见。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了AIpsych基准，用于系统分析模型行为，并研究了模型架构和参数规模对行为的影响。

Result: 实验表明，随着模型规模增大，VLMs表现出更强的奉承倾向但减少的权威偏见，暗示能力提升但可能损害回答的完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLMs幻觉提供了新视角，并强调了将心理学原则融入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了可解释提升机（EBM）在大气科学中的应用，结合特征工程开发可解释的机器学习算法，用于卫星图像中的超顶（OTs）检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在高风险应用中具有优势，但在大气科学中应用较少。本文旨在开发可解释的、基于物理的机器学习算法，并简化OTs检测流程。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），应用EBM进行分类任务，结合卫星数据（可见光和红外图像）和标签训练模型。

Result: EBM模型在人类-机器协作下开发，虽未达到复杂方法的精度，但表现良好，为可解释ML算法的发展迈出重要一步。

Conclusion: EBM为气象应用提供了一种可解释的机器学习方法，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升番茄病害识别能力，有望提高作物产量和食品安全。

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Motivation: 研究在简化条件下如何高效计算刚体的旋转，同时减少对场景先验知识的依赖。

Method: 基于正交投影和固定相机视角，通过跟踪一个特征点解析计算旋转速率，适用于并行处理。

Result: 该方法独立于物体形状，无需场景先验知识，并能通过旋转速率差异实现场景分割。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实验中均验证了其有效性，适用于刚体旋转分析。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，通过抑制主体特异性线索来提升人类活动识别的泛化能力，在三个公开数据集上表现优于传统对比学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中备受关注。然而，HAR传感器信号因主体差异导致显著的域偏移，影响模型对新主体的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一主体的负样本对，抑制主体特异性信息，突出活动特异性特征。

Result: 在UTD-MHAD、MMAct和DARai三个公开数据集上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL不仅适用于多种自监督方法，还能在多模态和监督学习框架中灵活应用，显著提升了HAR模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Result: 模型轻量、泛化能力强，支持直观的图像编辑和风格化。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了图像合成的应用场景，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Result: 实验显示部分视觉编码器贡献极小或负面，证实冗余现象普遍。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计效率低下，CUR和IG可作为诊断工具优化多模态架构。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Result: 在四个实测双频PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，SKDNet-SSR优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR有效解决了双频PolSAR图像分类中的关键问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

Conclusion: 刚性基准测试可能低估模型能力，ConceptMix++ 提供了更准确的评估方法，并为未来发展提供见解。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法依赖微调，成本高且可能导致性能下降，需一种更高效、直接的方法。

Method: 在训练过程中随机将小批量数据分为遗忘集和保留集，优化模型使其无法预测遗忘集，通过撤销键实现即时遗忘。

Result: {\pname}在多种数据集和架构上表现优于基于微调和无微调的方法。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效、直接的机器遗忘解决方案，避免了传统方法的缺点。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Result: 在ScanNet25k数据集上优于现有弱监督方法4.3%，并首次超越监督方法ROCA 2.7%。在SUN2CAD新类别测试集上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督条件下实现了高性能，并能泛化到新类别，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Conclusion: SemiOVS能有效利用未标记OOD图像，为半监督语义分割任务提供新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Human-Animal-Cartoon等数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态域泛化性能，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

Motivation: 将文本定义的作者写作风格转化为视觉表示是生成AI中的新挑战，旨在实现跨模态理解和创意辅助。

Method: 利用AWS作为输入，通过LLM生成三个文本提示，再用扩散模型生成图像。评估基于Reddit的49种作者风格。

Conclusion: 提出了一种端到端的视觉作者风格个性化方法，为创意辅助和跨模态理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中隐私问题限制了敏感数据的访问，SFUDA无需目标域标注数据即可进行域适应，但存在原型样本质量低和伪标签分配错误的问题。

Method: 方法分为三个阶段：1) 可靠样本记忆模块（RSM）提升原型样本质量；2) 多视图对比学习（MVCL）增强伪标签质量；3) 噪声标签过滤技术进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种先进方法平均提升了约2%和6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键挑战，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Conclusion: MIMO框架为自动广告设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in
producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial
design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，动态卷积虽适用但缺乏对时序动态和上下文依赖的捕捉。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升CSLR的泛化能力和准确性，且SR-CTC无推理开销，可无缝集成。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 基础设计选择的优化与架构创新同样重要，为未来方法提供了强有力指导。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Result: MRC-DETR显著提高了检测效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了高效且准确的解决方案，并填补了数据集空白。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Conclusion: MTID通过改进监督和生成机制，有效提升了动作序列的连贯性和任务相关性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

TL;DR: Pose-Star框架通过动态重组身体结构生成解剖感知掩码，解决了现有两阶段流程在掩码可控性和姿态鲁棒性上的不足，实现了用户自定义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段流程（掩码生成+扩散编辑）过于关注生成器优化，忽视了掩码可控性，导致用户定义灵活性和姿态鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出Pose-Star框架，通过骨骼关键点校准扩散注意力（Star tokens），结合相位感知分析和阈值掩码等技术，动态生成解剖感知掩码。

Result: Pose-Star在复杂姿态下增强罕见结构定位，抑制噪声，并通过边缘细化提升编辑质量。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了控制基准与开放需求之间的空白，为工业时尚图像编辑奠定了基础。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Motivation: 现有防御方法无法应对未知攻击，导致对抗鲁棒性的泛化问题。本文旨在挖掘不同攻击的共性特征，以提升对未见攻击的防御能力。

Method: 揭示对抗样本的低熵先验（LE），提出两阶段REAL方法：1）通过反向最大化预测熵修正低熵误分类样本；2）通过正向最小化预测熵确保修正样本正确分类。引入攻击感知权重机制调整优化强度。

Result: 实验表明，REAL显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: LE先验为对抗样本防御提供了新视角，REAL方法通过两阶段熵优化和攻击感知机制，有效提升了对抗鲁棒性的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NCU的去噪对应遗忘微调框架，旨在直接消除预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）中噪声对应（NC）的有害影响，提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型数据需求的增长，噪声对应样本的引入显著降低了模型性能，现有方法难以满足实际需求。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过学习最难负样本信息，为假阳性和假阴性提供明确的遗忘方向，并将其统一为最优传输目标进行快速微调。

Result: 在多种下游任务中验证了NCU的有效性，其在零样本迁移任务上表现优于现有鲁棒预训练方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU为提升预训练VLMs的鲁棒性提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合多种特征和注意力机制，显著提升了稀疏雷达点云中的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their
surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for
reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过随机多裁剪增强的方法，激活CLIP模型对局部特征的潜在分析能力，解决了其对全局图像模式的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程主要依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽略了细粒度局部语义，而现有方法假设视觉语言模型（VLMs）能识别局部细节，但实验表明CLIP对全局模式的偏见限制了其处理局部描述符的能力。

Method: 采用随机多裁剪增强技术，通过裁剪局部区域约束模型的感受野并重新校准其注意力机制，从而减少全局偏见。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够显著提升CLIP对局部细节的处理能力，实现“既见森林又见树木”的效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要实时感知周围移动物体，传统方法依赖时间序列数据，而雷达直接提供速度信息，但雷达点云稀疏且噪声大，需要高效分割方法。

Method: 开发了Radar Velocity Transformer，利用速度信息进行单次扫描分割，并提出基于Transformer的上采样方法以克服稀疏点云插值限制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用雷达速度信息实现了高效准确的移动物体分割，为自动驾驶提供了实时场景理解能力。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Motivation: 传统二值化方法在变化检测中限制了网络的表示能力和特征区分性，导致检测精度下降。

Method: BiCD引入基于信息瓶颈原则的辅助目标，设计紧凑的可学习辅助模块近似计算互信息，优化重构损失和标准变化检测损失。

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上，BiCD实现了二值网络变化检测的最新性能。

Conclusion: BiCD为二值神经网络在变化检测领域设定了新基准，性能达到最优。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

Motivation: 细粒度视频分类需要理解复杂的时空和语义线索，单一模态难以胜任。

Method: 使用GRU序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制融合多模态表示，结合分类或回归损失训练，并通过特征级增强和自编码技术正则化。

Result: 在两个挑战性基准测试（DVD和Aff-Wild2数据集）上表现显著优于单模态基线，跨注意力和特征增强对鲁棒性和性能贡献显著。

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架在细粒度视频分类任务中表现优越，跨模态注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models

comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASOT虽然是无监督动作分割的先进方法，但其缺乏段级监督，限制了帧与动作表示之间的反馈效果。

Method: CLOT通过编码器-解码器架构，解决两个独立的最优传输问题，学习伪标签和帧/段嵌入，并通过交叉注意力进一步优化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，循环学习对无监督动作分割有显著改进。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环学习机制，有效提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Conclusion: 结合领域专用模型与通用基础模型可优化人脸识别性能，尤其是在低误匹配率场景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种2.5D目标检测框架，专为路边基础设施摄像头设计，解决了传统3D检测在俯视角下的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的传感器可能被遮挡或视野受限，而路边基础设施的感知系统可以提供补充信息，但传统3D检测方法在俯视角下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用2.5D检测框架，通过预测地面车辆为图像中的平行四边形，保留平面位置、大小和方向，忽略高度。训练结合了真实和合成场景。

Result: 在未见过的摄像头视角和恶劣天气条件下表现出高检测精度、强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了有效的补充感知手段，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Motivation: 研究动机是验证视频基础模型是否能作为通用领域无关方法，有效迁移到不同科学任务中。

Method: 通过SciVid基准测试（包含五个科学视频任务），评估并调整六种领先的ViFMs，使用简单的可训练读出模块。

Result: 结果表明，ViFMs在多个应用中能取得最先进的结果，但也揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 结论是ViFMs在科学应用中具有潜力，但仍需开发更具通用性的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

TL;DR: Causal-SAM-LLM框架通过语言对抗解耦和测试时因果干预，提升了医学图像分割模型的泛化能力，显著提高了OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学图像分割中因学习虚假相关性而无法泛化到未见域的问题。

Method: 结合冻结的SAM编码器，引入语言对抗解耦（LAD）和测试时因果干预（TCI）技术。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，Causal-SAM-LLM显著提升了Dice分数（6.2点）并减少了Hausdorff距离（15.8毫米）。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: EEG-VJEPA是一种基于V-JEPA的自监督学习方法，用于EEG分类，通过联合嵌入和自适应掩码学习时空特征，在TUH数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据少、高维度和缺乏可扩展模型的问题，现有自监督学习方法未能充分捕捉时空依赖性。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，采用V-JEPA框架学习时空表示，结合联合嵌入和自适应掩码。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注文本模态的原型学习，忽略了类名的模糊语义，导致原型无法充分捕捉视觉概念，性能受限。

Method: ProtoMM通过将原型视为文本描述和视觉粒子的离散分布，动态更新视觉粒子，并结合最优传输问题量化原型与测试图像的语义距离。

Result: 在15个零样本基准测试中，ProtoMM平均准确率提升1.03%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型学习和动态更新机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型在测试时的适应能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

Motivation: 探索视觉嵌入模型是否能通过线性方向捕捉连续有序属性，以支持图像排名等新应用。

Method: 通过7种流行编码器和9个数据集，测试模型在年龄、人群数量等属性上的“可排名性”。

Result: 许多嵌入模型具有内在可排名性，仅需少量样本即可恢复排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究为图像排名提供了新思路，并推动对可排名嵌入结构的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SAMed-2通过创新的内存机制和适配器设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现出更高的准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: 展示了LLMs在手语识别中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Method: 系统基于视频数据，利用骨骼数据的少量特征和简化的LSTM网络，减少计算需求。

Result: 计算需求比现有模块低18倍，准确率达88%。

Conclusion: 该系统适合工业和住宅安全领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Result: SimpAgent减少了27%的FLOPs，并在多样化的GUI导航任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Method: 提出自一致的跟踪模块和基于补丁的动态映射模块，结合3DGS点图避免尺度漂移并引入几何先验。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在视图合成和跟踪精度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS通过改进的跟踪和映射模块，显著提升了户外3DGS SLAM的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time Consistency Models在训练中存在不稳定性，原因是模型仅学习概率流的捷径而忽略了瞬时速度场。

Method: 提出FACM，利用Flow Matching任务作为锚点，无需修改架构即可稳定训练。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，NFE=2时FID为1.32，NFE=1时为1.76，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACM为构建高性能少步生成模型提供了通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building

Conclusion: ChestGPT可作为辅助工具，减轻放射科医生负担，提高诊断效率。

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Conclusion: StreamDiT为实时视频生成提供了有效解决方案，适用于流媒体生成、交互式生成等应用。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优准确率，能耗降低65%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且节能，为事件和帧数据的语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DINOv2预训练策略，通过频率过滤课程和高斯噪声补丁增强，显著加速收敛并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要高计算资源，限制了其在私有数据或新模态中的应用。本文旨在降低预训练的计算需求。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强，优化ViT-B/16在ImageNet-1K上的训练。

Result: 预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性，线性探测性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种零内存开销的容错技术，通过替换ViT参数的最低位为奇偶校验位来检测比特翻转故障，并通过掩码处理提升可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ViT在安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）中的普及，确保其在比特翻转故障下的正确功能变得至关重要。

Method: 将参数的最低位替换为奇偶校验位以检测故障，检测到故障时通过掩码处理（置零）受影响参数。

Result: 该方法显著提升了ViT参数的鲁棒性，对比特翻转的容忍度提高了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 这是一种零开销的容错解决方案，适用于关键应用中的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法通常在单一数据集上训练，导致数据集特定的归纳偏差和泛化能力受限。多数据集联合训练虽能缓解此问题，但数据集间的差异会限制特征聚合层的信息容量。

Method: 提出Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA)，利用学习到的查询作为参考码本，通过计算Cross-query Similarity (CS)生成鲁棒描述符。

Result: QAA在性能上优于现有最优模型，实现了跨数据集的平衡泛化，同时保持与数据集特定模型相当的峰值性能。

Conclusion: QAA是一种高效且可扩展的特征聚合方法，能够显著提升VPR模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以准确反映提示中的所有语义信息，且缺乏自动检测机制。

Method: 采用B-cos模块构建扩散模型，提供解释性分析，显示每个提示词对图像像素区域的影响。

Result: B-cos扩散模型能生成高质量图像，并提供提示与图像对齐的有意义见解。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像质量的同时，增强了模型的可解释性，有助于理解提示词与生成图像的关系。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Result: 在多个自动驾驶数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ArmGS方法有效提升了动态场景建模的精度和渲染效率。

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注短距离去雾，长距离去雾因信号损失和严重雾霾而未被充分研究。近红外模态提供互补信息，但现有方法未充分利用语义一致性。

Method: 提出HSVF框架，包含语义流（重建无雾场景）和视觉流（从近红外模态恢复结构细节），通过双流协作实现高对比度和丰富纹理。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在长距离去雾任务中优于现有方法，生成高对比度且细节丰富的场景。

Conclusion: HSVF通过语义和视觉层次融合，有效解决了长距离去雾问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Result: 在多个公共HAR基准测试中，该方法显著优于11种现有基线，适用于跨人、跨数据集和跨位置场景。

Conclusion: 该方法通过揭示因果机制，在跨域活动识别中表现出高效性、有效性和普适性。

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Result: 在Real3D-AD和Anomaly-ShapeNet数据集上，Object-level AUROC分别为79.9%和79.5%，Point-level AUROC分别为71.2%和84.7%。

Conclusion: DUS-Net通过保留几何结构和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and
84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 为高效、高质量、多功能的数字人生成提供了解决方案，解决了性能和实用性的挑战。

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在放射学报告生成中更注重语言流畅性而非临床有效性，且难以捕捉图像与文本的关系。

Method: 采用最优传输（OT）对齐图像特征与疾病标签，设计了对齐与微调模块，并引入疾病预测模块。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成和临床效能指标上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG框架显著提升了放射学报告的临床准确性和语言连贯性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DNF-Intrinsic明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic通过改进输入和约束机制，实现了更高质量的逆渲染。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有GCN方法将交互个体视为独立图，忽略其内在依赖；预定义交互矩阵无法适应动态和上下文特定的联合交互。

Conclusion: ASEA通过动态节点选择和外部注意力机制，显著提升了交互建模的效果。

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Conclusion: RoSe通过光照过渡场和低秩约束，实现了高效去噪和多视角一致的正常光照合成。

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Result: 在标准基准和新定义的RoadAnomaly子集上，框架表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂驾驶环境中的OOD语义分割提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

Conclusion: NRSeg有效利用合成数据提升BEV分割性能，噪声鲁棒性和非互斥性处理是关键创新点。

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

TL;DR: 提出一种新的DGFAS框架，通过FOD和GS-RM联合对齐权重和偏置，解决跨域分类阈值不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法仅对齐局部决策边界的权重，而偏置项未对齐，导致分类阈值不一致和性能下降。

Method: 结合FOD（特征正交分解）和GS-RM（组尺度风险最小化），分别对齐权重和偏置。FOD通过Gram-Schmidt正交化分解特征空间，GS-RM通过平衡多域组损失对齐偏置。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现SOTA性能，提升准确性、减少偏置不对齐，增强未见目标域的泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了权重和偏置的对齐问题，显著提升了跨域性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

Method: 使用UK Countryside Survey数据，评估CNN和ViT模型在监督和监督对比学习下的表现。

Result: ViT在分类指标上优于CNN（Top-3准确率91%，MCC=0.66），监督对比学习减少相似栖息地的误分类。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态专业知识，为地面栖息地监测提供可扩展、经济高效的框架，助力生物多样性保护。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

Motivation: 持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题严重，尤其在ViT中使用MLP时，需改进模型以保留旧知识。

Method: 用KANs替代ViT中的MLPs，利用基于样条的激活实现局部可塑性，减少参数更新范围。

Result: KAN-based ViTs在MNIST和CIFAR100上显著减少灾难性遗忘，优于传统MLP-based ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境中的模型提供了更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Conclusion: 可控多模态代理在将静态文本转换为动态演示方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过合成数据和多阶段方法有效提升了动态类别发现的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Method: 提出跨模态特征插值和扩散模型，增强多模态学习和领域不变特征。

Result: 实验证明DOCTOR模型有效。

Conclusion: DOCTOR模型在多模态虚假信息检测中具有领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的记忆库和AAA策略有效解决了预测中的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Motivation: 解决在复杂环境和动态场景中多目标跟踪的挑战，如轨迹中断和动态参数学习。

Method: 结合高斯过程和非齐次泊松过程作为运动和观测模型，提出两种跟踪器（GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion），采用粒子滤波推理方案。

Result: GaPP-ReaCtion显著减少轨迹中断（如真实雷达数据减少30%），性能优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景中表现优越，适用于动态跟踪和分类任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Motivation: 解决基于窗口的自注意力模型因感受野有限和计算复杂度高而难以扩展的问题。

Method: 提出CPB，包括全局锚点提示层（GAPL）和两个局部提示层（LPLs），通过跨尺度注意力和自注意力机制实现全局感知和局部细化。

Result: 在定量、定性和复杂度评估中优于现有轻量级超分辨率方法。

Conclusion: PromptSR通过结合全局先验和局部细节，显著提升性能且保持低计算成本。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/wenyang001/PromptSR.

of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal
representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Motivation: 传统文本到图像合成方法依赖大量人工标注数据且难以精确控制复杂视觉属性和空间关系，Hi-SSLVLM旨在通过自监督学习解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段自监督学习：第一阶段通过多粒度视觉-语言对齐生成层次化标题；第二阶段通过内部组合规划机制和语义一致性损失指导图像生成。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM在可控性和语义一致性方面取得了显著进展，为开放式文本到图像生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: LVLM-Composer在可控性和组合准确性方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations

Motivation: 动态场景生成在增强/虚拟现实和机器人领域有广泛应用，但现有方法因依赖多视图训练而限制了场景范围和相机移动。

Method: 将单视图视频映射为动态点云，利用射线上下文渲染新视图并外绘视频，以生成3D一致的运动。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成无界场景，并保持运动一致性，且可通过场景提示控制生成内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager通过射线上下文和点云更新，实现了单视图下无界动态场景的生成。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

Result: 动态范围扩展一个数量级，数字合并在高增益下优于模拟合并，应用场景包括高动态范围成像等。

Conclusion: 空间变化的增益和合并技术有效提升图像传感器性能，适用于多种摄影应用。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

Motivation: 现有零样本方法在图像恢复任务中迭代时间过长，需改进。

Conclusion: QBM和RRP能高效加速扩散模型的图像恢复任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

resolution and layout outputs. Specifically, DreamPoster is built upon our T2I
model, Seedream3.0 to uniformly process different poster generating types. For
dataset construction, we propose a systematic data annotation pipeline that
precisely annotates textual content and typographic hierarchy information
within poster images, while employing comprehensive methodologies to construct
paired datasets comprising source materials (e.g., raw graphics/text) and their
corresponding final poster outputs. Additionally, we implement a progressive
training strategy that enables the model to hierarchically acquire multi-task
generation capabilities while maintaining high-quality generation. Evaluations
on our testing benchmarks demonstrate DreamPoster's superiority over existing
methods, achieving a high usability rate of 88.55\%, compared to GPT-4o
(47.56\%) and SeedEdit3.0 (25.96\%). DreamPoster will be online in Jimeng and
other Bytedance Apps.

*Xinbo Wang,Wenju Xu,Qing Zhang,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练模型和语义适配器的肖像风格迁移方法，通过AdaIN-Wavelet变换和双条件扩散模型实现高质量语义对齐的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在不同领域中泛化能力不足以及风格化过程中语义对齐不精确的问题。

Method: 使用预训练模型和语义适配器建立密集语义对应，结合AdaIN-Wavelet变换平衡内容保留与风格化，并通过双条件扩散模型生成最终结果。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种领域中均能实现高质量语义对齐的风格化。

Conclusion: 该方法在泛化能力和风格化质量上表现优越，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

TL;DR: MoReMouse是一种用于实验室小鼠的单目密集3D重建网络，通过合成数据集、变压器架构和地标嵌入，显著提升了重建精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室小鼠在生物医学研究中至关重要，但复杂的非刚性形变和无纹理外观使得3D运动重建困难，且缺乏结构化3D数据集限制了进展。

Method: 1. 构建高保真合成数据集；2. 采用基于变压器的三平面表示架构；3. 引入地标嵌入提升重建稳定性。

Result: MoReMouse在精度和鲁棒性上显著优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: MoReMouse为小鼠3D重建提供了高效解决方案，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

TL;DR: GSTDS算法通过动态调整训练数据子集，利用预训练模型和谱分析优化数据选择，显著降低计算需求并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化神经网络训练中的数据管理，减少冗余计算，提升训练效率和模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出GSTDS算法，基于预训练模型和Fiedler向量评分机制动态筛选数据子集，减少每批次处理的数据量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低4倍，性能不降反升，优于现有方法JEST。

Conclusion: GSTDS展示了谱分析在高效深度学习中的潜力，为自适应数据管理策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大型网络和标注数据，难以在资源受限平台上部署。

Method: 设计了一个仅含两层卷积的骨干无关特征提取器，并提出无参数迭代恢复模块和无监督训练目标。

Result: 在LOL数据集上PSNR达19.04 dB，参数仅0.07%，在移动处理器上实时处理4K图像。

Conclusion: LiteIE是资源受限平台上高效实用的低光增强解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates
dependence on large-scale supervision and generalizes well across diverse
conditions. We design a backbone-agnostic feature extractor with only two
convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解基准局限于英语且缺乏深度推理能力，无法满足医学教育等专业领域的需求。

Method: M3-Med通过多跳推理任务（文本定位、视觉证据查找、跨模态信息合成）设计，并定义了两个任务（TAGSV和TAGVC）。

Result: 评估显示，现有模型与人类专家在复杂多跳问题上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI模型在专业领域深度跨模态推理的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法在极低位量化下性能下降严重，主要由于量化器设计不友好、初始化策略不佳和优化方法不足。

Method: 提出Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed Quantization处理异常值，Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization优化初始化，以及Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation保持时间一致性。

Result: 在多种生成任务中，MPQ-DMv2显著优于现有方法，尤其在极低位量化下表现突出。

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2为极低位扩散模型量化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）面临域偏移大和数据多样性不足的挑战，现有方法难以适应大域偏移。

Method: 利用Lyapunov Exponent（LE）测量调整学习率，使模型训练在混沌边缘进行，平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上实验，LEAwareSGD在低数据情况下性能提升高达9.47%。

Conclusion: 训练接近混沌边缘能有效提升SDG任务的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Result: DLCN数据集具有高多样性和真实性，为评估算法在复杂条件下的鲁棒性提供了资源。

Conclusion: DLCN数据集和Happy-rPPG工具包的发布有助于推动rPPG在夜间动态光照环境中的研究。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The

Motivation: 大气湍流（AT）导致监控图像模糊和失真，影响目标分类和场景跟踪，现有深度学习方法在失真条件下效果不佳。

Method: 使用3D Mamba结构处理时空位移和模糊，通过金字塔方式提取特征并传递给检测器，联合优化AT缓解器和目标检测器。

Result: DMAT在受湍流影响的测试集上比现有方法性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT框架有效解决了AT引起的图像失真问题，同时提升了目标检测的准确性。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

Motivation: 现有医学VQA方法独立提取图像和文本特征，忽略了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间相关性，导致回答不精确。

Method: 构建跨模态图，将CT切片和问题标记作为节点，利用图卷积网络动态融合信息，生成软提示引导LLM回答。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过图表示和LLM的结合，有效解决了医学VQA中的特征融合问题，提升了回答的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时实现高效性、长程建模和完整场景信息保留。

Method: 利用状态空间模型（SSMs）和线性注意力的线性复杂度及长程建模能力，提出高度保真LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得75.0的NDS最高分，超越高分辨率输入方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过高度保真编码和混合Mamba块，实现了高效且高性能的多模态融合。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

Motivation: 跨模态遥感图像配准面临非线性辐射变化和纹理限制的挑战，现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）存在局部感受野或高计算复杂度的问题。

Method: 提出RegistrationMamba架构，结合多方向交叉扫描策略（线性复杂度捕获全局特征）和多专家特征学习（MEFL）策略（动态融合多专家特征）。还包括多级特征聚合（MFA）模块。

Result: 在多种分辨率的CRSI上实验表明，RegistrationMamba优于现有方法，具有更高的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过全局与局部特征的有效结合，显著提升了跨模态遥感图像配准的精度和适应性。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖神经渲染技术，难以在大规模上生成详细3D结构，主要由于2D观测的结构模糊性。

Method: 提出Sat2City框架，包含级联潜在扩散模型、Re-Hash操作和逆采样策略，用于从卫星图像逐步恢复3D结构。

Result: 在合成的大规模3D城市数据集上验证，Sat2City从单张卫星图像生成高保真3D结构，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Sat2City通过创新方法解决了3D城市生成的挑战，为游戏、数字孪生等应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视图一致性分布的NeRF训练方法，替代固定深度值估计，通过采样分布和深度推动损失实现有效正则化，显著提升新视图合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计方法需要昂贵的3D监督且泛化性差，尤其在户外无界场景中表现不佳，因此需要更鲁棒的深度正则化方法。

Method: 利用低层颜色特征和高层蒸馏特征计算视图一致性分布，通过采样分布和深度推动损失联合正则化NeRF训练。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 视图一致性分布和深度推动损失结合，有效解决了深度估计的局限性，提升了NeRF的性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Conclusion: MVNet能高效处理复杂HSI数据，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食物类别，缺乏对多种食物属性（如甜度、重量等）的综合基准，且RGB相机难以准确感知这些属性。

Method: 通过整合现有数据集并收集数百种食物的高光谱图像，结合实验仪器测定食物属性，构建了包含3,266个食物类别和2,351k数据点的基准。

Result: 大规模模型在数字化食物方面表现不佳，光谱数据对分析食物属性（如甜度）至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，推动智能食物分析的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在图像预测中存在冗余信息且缺乏动态、空间和语义等全面世界知识，限制了机器人操作任务的泛化和推理能力。

Conclusion: DreamVLA通过整合全面世界知识预测和解耦表示，显著提升了机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以实现空间组合与输入文本的对齐，布局规划与生成过程分离导致优化困难。

Method: CoT-Diff框架在单次扩散过程中嵌入逐步推理，利用MLLM动态评估和更新3D布局，并通过条件感知注意力机制注入语义和深度信息。

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Diff在3D场景基准上显著优于现有方法，复杂场景空间准确率提升34.7%。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff证明了紧密耦合生成范式的有效性，为复杂场景的文本到图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

Result: BiVM在计算和存储成本上分别节省14.3倍和21.6倍，性能优于现有二值化方法。

Conclusion: BiVM通过优化特征提取和计算冗余，实现了高效且准确的视频抠图。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的框架FA，通过强制提示学习充分利用ID知识，显著提升OOD检测效果，无需外部辅助数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法依赖OOD相关知识或外部数据集，泛化能力有限，需改进。

Method: 学习包含ID类多样化描述的强制提示，增强ID图像与提示的语义相似性，引入强制系数优化描述。

Result: 在无需外部数据集的情况下，OOD检测效果显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FA框架通过利用ID知识，有效提升OOD检测性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合空间基础的手势生成框架，填补了现有研究中手势与空间环境分离的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常专注于描述性动作生成或孤立的手势合成，缺乏对空间基础和环境感知的结合，限制了具身交互代理的发展。

Method: 引入了一个多模态数据集和框架，结合合成数据集和VR对话数据集，提供同步的运动、语音和3D场景信息，并连接物理模拟器进行数据生成和评估。

Result: 提供了7.7小时的标准化数据，为空间基础手势生成奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为空间基础手势生成和多模态交互研究提供了重要资源和方法框架。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

*Philipp Reis,Joshua Ransiek,David Petri,Jacob Langner,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象级新颖性检测的实时数据选择方法，以构建更平衡和多样化的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据收集往往偏向常见场景和对象，导致新颖案例代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性分数，识别并丢弃冗余内容。

Result: 减少训练数据集大小可提高模型性能，而数据冗余增加时更激进的过滤方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时部署，能持续更新正常内容的定义，高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive
generative modeling due to the high dimensionality of video data. This work
introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在细粒度编辑任务（如人脸编辑）中容易丢失身份信息或改变无关区域，S$^2$Edit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过正交约束解耦身份令牌与编辑属性，利用对象掩码引导交叉注意力图，实现局部化编辑。

Result: 实验表明，S$^2$Edit在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，并能应用于化妆转移等任务。

Conclusion: S$^2$Edit在保持身份信息的同时实现了精确的语义和空间控制，为图像编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣天气下表现稳健，但其稀疏点和噪声测量限制了性能提升，现有研究多依赖相机图像融合，潜力未充分挖掘。

Method: 设计了两阶段融合网络：第一阶段通过雷达引导的迭代BEV融合模块生成高召回率3D提案框；第二阶段聚合多视图特征（点、图像、BEV）以优化提案。

Result: 在公开数据集上显著优于现有方法，View-of-Delft和TJ4DRadSet的mAP分别提升9.10%和3.68%。

Conclusion: CVFusion通过跨视图特征融合有效提升了4D雷达的3D目标检测性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态嵌入模型（如VLM2Vec、E5-V、GME）主要针对自然图像，对其他视觉形式（如视频和视觉文档）支持有限，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出VLM2Vec-V2框架，并扩展MMEB-V2基准，新增五种任务类型（如视频检索、视觉文档检索等），训练支持多模态输入的通用嵌入模型。

Result: VLM2Vec-V2在新任务（视频和文档检索）上表现优异，同时在原有图像基准上超越基线模型。

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2展示了多模态嵌入模型的泛化能力，为研究和实际应用中的统一嵌入学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种新的微调框架，通过QR分解实现结构化参数更新，有效分离视觉属性，减少参数数量并避免特征纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在结合多个LoRA模型时，常因权重矩阵的非结构化修改导致内容与风格属性的特征纠缠。

Method: 利用QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的任务特定ΔR矩阵，实现结构化参数更新。

Result: QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中实现了更好的解耦，参数数量仅为传统LoRA方法的一半。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效且解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HiLa的分层视觉语言协作框架，用于改进基于全切片图像的癌症生存预测，通过多级语言提示和视觉特征对齐，结合跨层次传播和互对比学习模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的切片级标签，无法从千兆像素图像中学习区分性表示；视觉语言模型虽有潜力，但当前方法仅使用单一语言提示和余弦相似度，无法捕捉多层次视觉特征与语言信息的细粒度关联。

Method: HiLa框架利用预训练特征提取器生成分层的视觉特征（补丁和区域级），通过最优提示学习（OPL）对齐多属性语言提示与视觉特征，并引入跨层次传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块增强层次间协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉语言协作和多模块设计，显著提升了生存预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Result: 方法在多个数据集上生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述，并通过标准评估指标和人工注释验证。

Conclusion: 提出的可解释神经分析方法能有效生成高质量视频描述，并为端到端学习提供自动教学支持。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: 实验显示模型性能显著提升，训练成本减半。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了误导性标注问题，提升了3D VQA的效率和准确性。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: SMoEStereo通过高效整合VFMs，显著提升了立体匹配的鲁棒性和跨域性能。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在轨迹预测中常忽略局部时间依赖和高阶运动状态属性，导致建模不充分。

Method: 提出LTMSformer框架，包括局部趋势感知注意力机制、运动状态编码器和轻量级提议细化模块。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%，模型尺寸减少68%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer通过改进时空依赖建模和高阶运动状态属性学习，显著提升了轨迹预测性能，同时保持轻量级。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates

*Jianjiang Yang,Ziyan Huang,Yanshu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReLoop是一个闭环训练框架，通过多模态一致性反馈机制减少MLLM中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLM在开放视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提升输出的一致性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，结合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，实现多模态一致性反馈。

Result: 实验表明ReLoop显著降低了幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLM中的幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MODA的新型注意力机制，解决了多模态学习中的注意力缺陷问题，通过双模态空间映射和自适应掩码注意力提升了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在整合多模态数据方面表现出色，但现有方法主要关注语言中心调整，忽略了多模态令牌的混合，导致在需要细粒度认知和情感理解的高级任务中存在挑战。

Method: 提出MODA机制，采用‘对齐后修正’策略，分离模态对齐与跨层令牌混合。通过双模态空间映射和自适应掩码注意力实现内模态优化和模态间交互。

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验验证了MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODA通过改进注意力机制，显著提升了多模态任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种认知启发的视角，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的“幻觉”问题重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并开发了TensionModulator（TM-ARC）控制器以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在“幻觉”问题，即生成内容与提示语义不一致。论文旨在从认知角度理解并解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了“Hallucination Tri-Space”概念，包含语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础三个关键轴，并开发了Alignment Risk Code（ARC）量化实时对齐张力。基于此，设计了TM-ARC控制器进行干预。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC能显著减少幻觉，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解T2I扩散模型中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注性能提升，但忽略了噪声和模态冲突带来的不确定性，尤其是在细粒度局部遮挡和帧丢失的情况下。

Method: UGG-ReID采用高斯补丁图表示模型量化局部不确定性，并设计不确定性引导的专家混合策略动态路由样本。

Result: 在五个多模态数据集上表现优异，显著优于现有方法，尤其在抗噪性方面。

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性建模有效提升了多模态目标重识别的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs无法拒绝与视频无关的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了'answerability alignment'框架和评估方法，并设计了数据集生成流程。

Result: 框架提升了Video-LLMs拒绝无关问题的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Video-LLMs在问题相关性评估上的空白，具有实际意义。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Motivation: 当前的多阶段建筑物轮廓提取方法复杂且扩展性差，而大语言模型的推理能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: VectorLLM采用视觉基础骨干网络、MLP连接器和LLM架构，结合可学习的位置嵌入，通过预训练、监督微调和偏好优化策略进行训练。

Conclusion: VectorLLM为遥感图像中的矢量提取提供了新范式，结合LLM的拓扑推理能力，实现了高精度和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

Motivation: 生物医学数据集通常存在样本不平衡和隐私限制，阻碍了机器学习模型的开发。合成图像可以改善数据可用性并保护隐私。

Method: 利用LoRA权重微调的稳定扩散模型生成合成图像，并结合少量真实样本指导，增强分类器性能。

Result: ResNet分类器准确率从27.3%提升至78.4%，CLIP分类器从61.8%提升至76.8%。合成图像与真实图像高度相似。

Conclusion: 合成图像是生物医学研究的有效工具，可提升模型性能并促进医学诊断和研究。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注图像级音频-视觉关联，忽略了时间动态，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准和TAVLO模型，整合高分辨率时间信息，支持四种复杂场景。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征而表现不佳，TAVLO通过时间建模实现了更鲁棒的定位。

Conclusion: 时间动态对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心AVL设立了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Motivation: 历史文档因老化、损坏等问题难以修复，现有方法无法满足实际需求。

Method: AutoHDR采用三阶段方法：OCR辅助损伤定位、视觉-语言上下文文本预测、块自回归外观修复。

Result: AutoHDR将严重损坏文档的OCR精度从46.83%提升至84.05%，人机协作下可达94.25%。

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复领域取得重要进展，为文化遗产保护做出贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and
dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

TL;DR: 提出Tempo-R0模型，通过多模态时间感知强化解决时序视频定位任务，采用自适应注意力分配和显式时间戳对齐方法，实验表现优于现有方法3.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序视频定位任务因视频信息量大且冗余而极具挑战性，需模型全面理解视频以准确检索相关片段。

Method: 使用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳对齐（ETA）预处理，并应用部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）进行微调。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试集上表现优于现有方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化显著提升了时序视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Motivation: 探索如何将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中，以解锁高级视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段范式：1）大规模语言冷启动微调；2）多模态强化学习（RL），共近1000步训练。

Result: 模型Open-Vision-Reasoner（OVR）在多个推理基准测试中达到SOTA性能，如MATH500（95.3%）、MathVision（51.8%）和MathVerse（54.6%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态推理模型的发展提供了关键见解和工具，推动了行为对齐的多模态推理器的进步。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Conclusion: 通过空间-时间解耦方法，有效解决了文本到视频生成中的身份一致性问题，为下游应用提供了高质量视频生成方案。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

TL;DR: GeoSapiens是一种基于少样本学习的框架，用于在有限标注的CBCT数据上实现稳健的牙齿标志点检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注CBCT图像耗时且存在观察者间差异，而传统深度学习方法因数据稀缺和标注成本高难以应用。

Method: 结合Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，优化解剖结构间的几何关系捕捉。

Result: 在严格0.5 mm阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙齿标志点检测提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Motivation: 解决广义类别发现（GCD）中因优化目标不一致和类别混淆导致的特征重叠问题，提升新类别的分类性能。

Method: 提出NC-GCD框架，预分配ETF原型以确保几何结构最优，设计一致性ETF对齐损失和语义一致性匹配器（SCM）来统一优化目标和稳定标签分配。

Result: 在多个GCD基准测试中表现优异，显著提高了新类别的分类准确率。

Conclusion: NC-GCD通过几何结构优化和一致性目标设计，有效解决了GCD中的关键问题，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对ControlNets的数据投毒攻击方法，能够在无文本触发的情况下生成特定内容（如NSFW），揭示了开源ControlNets管道的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，本文旨在揭示这一漏洞。

Method: 通过注入毒化样本（将微妙触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW内容，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，该方法实现了高攻击成功率，且毒化输入难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源ControlNets管道的严重漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 跨模态检索在制造业等专业领域至关重要，但缺乏公开数据集。本文旨在利用VLMs解决这一问题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动生成自由形式和结构化文本描述，并评估三种VLMs的检索性能。

Result: 结构化描述显著提升检索准确性，Meta的Perception Encoder表现最佳，但零样本检索在细粒度领域仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 结合技术性文本描述和先进VLMs可优化工业应用中的跨模态检索，需进一步研究领域适应方法。

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

Motivation: 评估LVLM在低层次视觉特征（如颜色、强度、方向）上的感知能力，以验证其是否与人类注意力机制一致。

Method: SalBench包含三个任务：Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out和Visual Referring Odd-One-Out，通过图像突出罕见或意外元素。

Result: LVLM表现不佳，即使是先进的GPT-4o在简单任务上准确率仅为47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench是衡量LVLM与人类注意力机制对齐能力的重要工具。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成可编辑和可重照明的资产。

Conclusion: MatDecompSDF在几何精度和材质保真度上表现优异，适用于数字内容创作。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

Result: MCFormer在标准化评估中表现最优，显著优于现有方法，并揭示了光学流模型的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为PIV领域提供了基准资源和先进方法，推动了未来研究的发展。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上，该方法显著优于现有单智能体和多智能体跟踪框架，性能提升达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制即可作为对抗条件下的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少了31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量的CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式拓扑表示，有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习场景下均优于现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: PCP框架通过渐进式剪枝有效减少精度损失，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

*Zeqi Luo,Ali Gooya,Edmond S. L. Ho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UDF-GMA通过建模数据和模型的不确定性，提升了基于姿态的自动化GMA的临床可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于姿态的自动化GMA方法因数据质量低和姿态估计噪声导致不确定性，缺乏可靠的临床应用。

Method: UDF-GMA显式建模模型参数的认知不确定性和数据噪声的随机不确定性，并通过贝叶斯近似估计认知不确定性。进一步融合不确定性与运动表示以增强分类。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的实验表明，UDF-GMA在预测不良运动模式方面具有有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过明确建模不确定性，显著提升了自动化GMA的临床可靠性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

TL;DR: SeqGrowGraph是一种新颖的框架，通过链式图扩展学习车道拓扑结构，模拟人类绘制地图的过程，在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以建模真实道路中的复杂非线性结构（如环路和双向车道），而准确的车道拓扑对自动驾驶至关重要。

Method: 将车道图表示为有向图，逐步引入顶点，通过邻接矩阵和几何矩阵编码连接性和中心线形状，使用Transformer模型自回归预测扩展序列。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph通过模拟人类绘图过程，有效解决了复杂车道拓扑建模问题，为自动驾驶提供了更准确的车道结构表示。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RIPE是一种基于强化学习的弱监督关键点提取框架，仅需二元标签即可训练，显著简化数据准备并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工变换或预生成模型，数据准备复杂且受限。RIPE旨在通过最小监督实现高效训练。

Method: 利用编码器中间层和超列方法提取多尺度关键点描述符，并引入辅助损失增强区分能力。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，简化数据准备的同时达到先进水平。

Conclusion: RIPE为关键点提取和描述提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

*Sourav Ghosh,Chayan Maitra,Rajat K. De*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CMET的新指标，用于量化嵌入质量，通过CMET_L和CMET_G分别衡量局部和全局结构保留能力，并在多种数据集上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标在时间和空间复杂度上较高，且无法有效量化嵌入质量，因此需要一种更高效的指标。

Method: 设计了CMET指标，包括CMET_L和CMET_G，分别评估嵌入的局部和全局结构保留能力。

Result: CMET在合成、生物和图像数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有低复杂度和稳定性。

Conclusion: CMET是一种高效可靠的嵌入质量评估指标，适用于各种数据类型和规模。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代卫星生成的数据量巨大，传统的地面处理延迟高，而现有ML模型体积或功耗过大，难以在卫星上部署。

Method: 开发了定制化的YOLOv8架构，针对FPGA处理优化，功耗低于10W，并在大型SAR数据集xView3-SAR上训练和评估。

Result: FPGA模型的检测和分类性能仅比GPU模型低约2%和3%，但体积小两到三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了高效的小型ML模型在SAR分析中的应用潜力，为自主、响应式的地球观测系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale

Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Result: 该基准能更全面、准确地评估MLLMs在人类中心视频理解中的能力。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench为MLLMs在人类中心视频领域的评估提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Result: 模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域可部分改善泛化，但无法完全克服地理差异。数据对齐等方法能提升空间泛化。

Conclusion: 研究提升了降尺度方法的全球适用性，减少高分辨率气候信息获取的不平等。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效消除了虚假相关性，提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click通过交互式设计和对象级特征对齐，显著提升了视频到音频生成的精确性和性能。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

TL;DR: InterGSEdit提出了一种基于交互式选择关键视图的3D高斯溅射编辑框架，解决了多视图编辑中的局部不一致性和用户控制不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法在多视图编辑中存在局部不一致性，且完全依赖文本提示导致用户难以灵活控制编辑程度。

Method: 通过CLIP语义一致性选择策略筛选参考视图，构建3D几何一致注意力先验，并通过注意力融合网络平衡3D和2D注意力。

Result: 实验表明，InterGSEdit实现了高质量的3DGS编辑，具有一致性和高保真度。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式选择和注意力融合，显著提升了3D编辑的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: TLB-VFI是一种高效的基于视频的扩散模型，通过提取时间信息，在视频帧插值任务中表现优异，参数更少且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的扩散模型无法提取时间信息且效率低，而基于视频的扩散模型则因规模过大而不实用。

Method: 提出TLB-VFI，结合3D小波门控和时间感知自编码器提取时间信息，并引入光流指导。

Result: 在最具挑战性的数据集上FID提升20%，参数减少3倍，速度提升2.3倍，训练数据需求减少9000倍。

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are

TL;DR: OPAL是一种人类辅助标注方法，通过混合整数线性规划（MILP）最小化标注努力，同时达到目标准确率。在测试视觉系统时，OPAL平均准确率达98.8%，减少一半以上人工标注，并显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习（DL）中准确标注数据的稀缺是主要挑战。尽管训练可以容忍标签噪声，但测试时需要高准确率以确保可靠性。

Method: OPAL采用MILP公式，最小化标注努力并满足目标准确率。评估包括自动标注测试数据和自动化验证测试数据。

Result: OPAL在七大数据集上平均准确率达98.8%，减少50%以上人工标注，且优于所有基线方法。自动化验证中，OPAL减少28.8%人工努力，准确率提高4.5%。

Conclusion: OPAL通过MILP和主动学习显著提升标注效率和准确率，适用于DL测试场景。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升眼科诊断的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

Method: 提出CVS-AdaptNet，通过图像嵌入与文本描述对齐，增强多标签分类性能。

Result: 在Endoscapes-CVS201数据集上，CVS-AdaptNet达到57.6 mAP，优于基线模型ResNet50（51.5 mAP）。

Conclusion: 多模态框架结合文本提示显著提升CVS识别性能，展示了通用模型在专业手术任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为手术计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

Conclusion: INTER通过模拟人类多模态认知行为，有效减少了LVLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Conclusion: MoDiT框架显著提升了音频驱动说话头生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

Conclusion: 该方法为高速4D重建提供了一种低成本、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Motivation: 社交媒体在危机事件中提供大量多模态数据，但从中提取有效信息并整合异构数据仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用VLMs（如LLaVA和CLIP）、Guided Cross Attention和Differential Attention机制，结合预训练模型和自适应融合策略。

Result: 在CrisisMMD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类准确率上优于现有模型，提升了灾难响应的可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合预训练VLMs、丰富文本描述和自适应融合策略，能显著提升多模态危机数据分类性能。

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧插值任务局限于少量帧和无文本控制，且缺乏官方定义和基准。本文旨在填补这一空白，支持更灵活的视频内容生成。

Method: 基于Wan2.1构建SemFi模型，引入Mixture-of-LoRA模块，确保多帧长度限制下的高一致性内容生成。

Result: 实验表明，SemFi模型在SFI-300K数据集上表现优异，满足SFI任务需求。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SFI任务和SemFi模型为视频内容生成提供了新方向，并通过数据集和基准验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

Motivation: 传统遥感方法难以应对破碎农业景观的时空异质性，而准确的稻田监测对粮食安全和农业政策至关重要。

Method: 研究采用物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区的农业生态变化进行本地化校准。

Result: 该框架整体准确率达93.3%，比传统方法提高8.0个百分点，并与政府统计数据高度一致（R^2=0.981）。

Conclusion: 研究证明，遥感框架需适应而非简化景观复杂性，以支持区域农业监测和政策应用。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D场景理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Conclusion: CTA为TTT提供了一种无需专用架构的有效改进方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 低帧率无人机视频中目标外观和位置的快速变化，以及视频流和压缩算法导致的图像退化，使得多目标跟踪任务极具挑战性。

Method: 通过从单帧标注中学习实例关联，并利用场景的全局特征提供上下文信息，以提高跟踪的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在军事车辆数据集上表现优异，为实际作战场景中的多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决一致性问题，为文本到3D生成提供高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Conclusion: ST-LLM有效提升了MLLMs在时空理解任务上的性能，为智能体在现实世界中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced

these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model

model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel

achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT和Llama在模拟人类意见时存在结构不一致和同质化问题，可能导致对少数群体意见的低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为人类意见替代样本的可行性，发现其可能误导政策制定。

Method: 通过向ChatGPT和Llama提问ANES 2020中的问题，分析其回答的结构一致性和多样性。

Result: LLMs表现出显著的结构不一致和严重的同质化，与人类数据差异明显。

Conclusion: LLMs不适合直接替代人类调查数据，可能强化刻板印象和误导政策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

Method: 通过重新设计训练数据格式和修改推理流程，提出端到端的联合模型。

Result: 在Task II中，模型相对基线提升了54.87%的tcpWER/tcpCER，排名第8。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了预分割音频的模糊性问题，展示了语音LLM在多任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

Motivation: 隐藏混杂因素是观测数据中估计处理效应的主要挑战，现有方法多依赖无混杂假设，而ProCI首次尝试利用LLMs解决这一问题。

Method: ProCI框架通过LLMs的语义推理能力发现潜在混杂因素，并利用其世界知识进行反事实推理，采用分布推理策略避免输出崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，ProCI能发现有意义的混杂因素，并在多种数据集和LLMs上显著提升处理效应估计的准确性。

Conclusion: ProCI为利用LLMs解决隐藏混杂问题提供了有效框架，显著提升了因果推断的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

Motivation: 评估心理理论（ToM）在动态协作环境中的表现，以促进人机协作的有效性。

Method: 设计了Instruction Inference任务，开发了基于LLM的代理Tomcat，包含Fs-CoT和CP两种变体，并在三种LLM上实现。

Result: Tomcat的Fs-CoT变体（尤其是GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1）在意图准确性、行动最优性和规划最优性上表现接近人类参与者。

Conclusion: Tomcat展示了在心理理论推理方面的潜力，为人机协作提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

Result: LLM在工程应用中缺乏定量可靠性，但提出的代理方法在基准数据集上实现了超过99.0%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过代码生成任务重构问题可以显著提升LLM在专业领域的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

Motivation: 研究如何通过组合性模型实现泛化和可解释性，并比较不同模型在组合任务中的表现。

Method: 使用DisCoCirc框架构建组合模型，测试量子电路和神经网络在bAbI任务扩展数据集上的表现。

Result: 两种模型在部分任务上表现相近，但在系统性任务上差异显著，神经网络更容易过拟合。

Conclusion: 组合性模型在泛化和可解释性方面有潜力，但不同架构在不同任务上表现各异。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

Conclusion: 结合传统知识与现代AI技术，可提供个性化、文化适宜的抑郁症支持。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

Motivation: LLMs在整合检索信息时常出现事实不一致问题，现有方法难以量化这种差距。

Method: 引入Entity-Context Divergence（ECD）度量，并开发Radiant框架，结合Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）优化检索信息与生成内容的交互。

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低，Radiant显著提升了在噪声、知识冲突等场景下的性能。

Conclusion: Radiant框架有效提高了LLMs生成内容的可靠性和事实一致性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助非英语心理咨询提供了基准，并指出通过提示工程、生成增强和微调改进的方向。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

Conclusion: RAG-R1框架有效提升了LLMs的推理能力和效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型缺乏特定领域的专业知识，尤其是在网络安全分析中表现不足。本文旨在通过DAP方法提升模型在网络安全领域的性能，同时保持其通用性。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，对三种解码器架构（Llama-3.1-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct）进行训练，使用126百万词的网络安全语料库。训练参数受限，并采用分布式FSDP训练。

Result: 在CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval三个基准测试中，模型表现显著提升。Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP模型分别达到0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于专用模型。数据效率高（118.8百万词 vs 2.77亿词）。

Conclusion: DAP方法在网络安全领域实现了高效领域适应，为威胁分析、漏洞评估等任务提供了专用AI助手的基础，并挑战了LLM领域适应的数据需求假设。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了压缩大型语言模型（LLMs）以解决数学应用题（MWPs）的可行性，通过压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量并蒸馏出更小的学生模型，实现了高效且低成本的教育应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学教育中潜力巨大，但计算资源需求高、成本昂贵，因此需要探索压缩模型的方法以降低成本。

Method: 压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量，并通过蒸馏技术训练一个参数更少的学生模型。

Result: 学生模型仅使用1/12的参数，性能接近教师模型的90%，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 压缩嵌入向量的方法高效且通用，为智能教育系统提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Motivation: 大语言模型在数字健康领域有潜力，但需确保其准确性、安全性和实用性，尤其是开源解决方案。

Method: 使用包含1000多个健康问题的数据集，评估模型在诚实性、帮助性和无害性上的表现。

Result: AlpaCare-13B表现最佳（准确率91.7%，无害性0.92），BioMistral-7B-DARE通过领域调优提升了安全性（0.90）。少样本提示将准确率从78%提升至85%。

Conclusion: 领域调优和少样本提示能提升模型性能，但复杂查询仍存在挑战，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming
digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However,
ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy,
usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source
solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over
1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty,
helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual
reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B,
BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest
accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in
BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot
prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced
helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

Motivation: 当前方法主要关注正推理路径，忽视了负推理路径在训练模型识别错误推理模式中的重要性。

Method: SMART框架利用AoT导向的思维链提示自动生成高质量的正负推理路径，并通过自我对齐提升推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，SMART显著提升了多种MLLM的推理能力，且不受模型架构、参数规模或预训练数据集的限制。

Conclusion: SMART通过迭代生成和优化方法持续提升模型推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各领域的广泛应用，需确保其符合人类价值观并防止负面后果，现有监控系统缺乏对特定用例和用户需求的考虑。

Method: GAF-Guard采用自主代理模型，识别风险并激活检测工具，实现持续监控和报告。

Result: 该框架增强了AI安全性和用户期望的满足。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard为LLM治理提供了以用户和用例为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究不同CQ生成方法的特点及其适用性，填补系统比较的空白。

Method: 采用三种方法（人工、模式实例化、LLM）生成CQs，并从多维度评估其质量。

Result: 不同方法生成的CQs具有不同特点，LLM生成的CQs需进一步优化。

Conclusion: LLM可作为CQ生成的初始工具，但需后续细化步骤。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示LLMs现有安全防护的不足，特别是在心理健康领域对抗性提示下的漏洞，以推动更有效的安全措施。

Method: 通过多步、提示级的越狱技术，设计了自杀和自残的测试案例，并在六种广泛使用的LLMs上进行了实证评估。

Result: 结果显示，用户意图被忽视，生成了可能导致现实伤害的详细有害内容，证明了绕过安全过滤器的普遍性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 结论强调了AI安全和伦理的多层次挑战，建议采取更系统化的安全措施和持续对抗性测试，同时指出通用LLMs在当前技术成熟度下难以实现全面安全。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在医疗领域关键但易出错的任务（ICD-10代码分类）中的表现，以确定其是否可用于自动化。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集中的1,500份摘要，测试11种LLMs，包括推理和非推理模型，采用临床NLP工具（cTAKES）提取术语，并以一致的编码格式提示模型。

Result: 模型表现不佳（F1≤57%），推理模型优于非推理模型，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳。某些代码（如慢性心脏病）分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs可辅助人工编码，但尚不可靠到完全自动化。未来需探索混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Result: 相比传统方法，准确率提升6.9%，数据效率更高，稳定性和泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 该方法有望促进社会平等和语言多样性，确保低资源语言不被忽视。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了协作环境下LLM的数据质量与训练效果。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Motivation: 传统方法依赖专家标注的同源词集，耗时且局限性强，本文旨在探索自动化替代方案。

Method: 比较自动同源词聚类和基于MSA的隐马尔可夫模型，评估其与专家分类和类型学数据的一致性。

Result: 基于MSA的方法生成的树更符合语言学分类，预测类型学变化更准确，信号更清晰。

Conclusion: MSA方法是一种有前景的、可扩展的替代方案，为全球语言谱系研究提供了新途径。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能协作设计策略以规避监控，测试其独立达成合谋的能力。

Method: 使用两个隔离的模型实例分别设计策略（P和M），在编程任务中合谋使M误判有害程序为无害。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率低，但偶尔能通过非明显信号成功合谋。

Conclusion: 语言模型具备一定合谋能力，但成功率受模型性能限制。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

Motivation: 当前T2I模型的多样化策略常忽略上下文适当性，导致过度多样化，甚至在提示中明确指定的属性也被修改。

Method: 提出DIVBENCH基准框架，系统评估T2I模型的多样性问题，并测试上下文感知方法（如LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写）。

Result: 大多数T2I模型多样性有限，但许多多样化方法过度修正，不恰当地修改上下文指定属性。上下文感知方法能有效平衡多样性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写）能有效解决T2I模型的多样性问题，避免过度多样化。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: 通过结构化工具调用和针对性强化学习微调，实现了可扩展且高精度的表格问答。

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无需训练的解码策略CNTP，通过在高熵步骤采样多个路径并选择最低困惑度的路径，显著提升LLM的解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流LLM的解码策略在模型对测试问题不确定时表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的解码方法。

Method: 在高熵步骤独立采样多个路径，遇到标点符号停止，选择困惑度最低的路径。

Result: CNTP在LLM和MLLM上均显著优于现有解码策略，结合自洽性可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is

Motivation: 研究LLM的个性化记忆存储，以支持长对话中的用户偏好建模。

Method: 提出Pref-LSTM框架，结合BERT分类器和LSTM记忆模块，生成记忆嵌入并通过软提示注入冻结的LLM。使用合成数据集训练BERT分类器。

Result: BERT分类器能可靠识别显式和隐式用户偏好，但LSTM记忆编码器效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合偏好过滤和LSTM门控原理是一种高效的用户偏好建模方法，无需大量开销和微调。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

TL;DR: K-Function框架通过结合子词转录、客观评分和可操作反馈，解决了儿童语言评估中的自动语音识别问题，显著提高了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语言评估因高音调、长音素和数据稀疏性导致自动语音识别困难，需要一种更准确且可解释的方法。

Method: 提出Kids-WFST，结合Wav2Vec2音素编码器和音素相似性Dysfluent-WFST，捕捉儿童特有错误并保持可解释性。

Result: 在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别实现1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪婪搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 高保真转录支持LLM生成语言技能评估和反馈，为可扩展的临床语言评估铺平道路。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CETRec提出了一种基于因果推理的框架，通过反事实推理增强LLM在推荐系统中对时序信息的利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的时序信息，限制了其对用户偏好演变的捕捉能力。

Method: CETRec利用因果推理，将时序信息作为独立因果因素，通过反事实推理量化其影响，并设计新的优化目标。

Result: CETRec显著提升了LLM对绝对和相对时序模式的识别能力。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果推理框架有效解决了LLM在推荐系统中时序信息利用不足的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交通事故数据中错误分类的问题，提升交通安全管理的准确性。

Method: 使用2019年爱荷华州交通部的数据，比较了SVM、XGBoost、BERT句子嵌入、BERT词嵌入和Albert模型。

Result: Albert模型与专家分类一致性最高（73%），且在模糊叙述中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 结合自动化分类与专家审查的混合方法能显著提升事故数据质量，对交通安全管理有重要意义。

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义互操作性标准部署耗时、资源密集和技术挑战的问题。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索，设计提示词引导模型将表格字段映射到FHIR资源。

Result: 初始基准测试中资源识别的F1分数为完美，GPT-4o表现优于Llama 3.2；实际条件下准确率略有下降至94%，但通过提示策略优化恢复。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于上下文感知的LLM驱动临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR可行，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应奖励跟随（ARF）框架，通过高精度情感分析器和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，将自由形式的用户反馈转化为连续偏好分数，优化强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）的个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法（如PPO、DPO）依赖二元偏好范式，虽降低标注成本，但需大量人工且仅捕捉群体趋势，无法满足个体偏好需求。

Method: 提出ARF框架，结合情感分析器和数据增强技术，动态跟踪用户偏好，并通过Trace Bias（TB）微调算法优化奖励模型。

Result: 在多个模型和偏好领域的实验中，ARF比PPO和DPO分别提升3.3%和7.6%，同时保持与PPO和DPO目标的理论一致性。

Conclusion: ARF通过自主奖励建模，提供了一种可扩展、个性化和成本效益高的RLHF方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

TL;DR: RLVER框架通过强化学习提升LLMs的情感智能，显著提高其共情能力，同时保持逻辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在逻辑推理方面表现出色，但其情感智能仍不足，需要探索强化学习在情感对话中的应用。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，利用模拟用户的情感评分作为奖励信号，通过PPO算法微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 模型的情感评分从13.3提升至79.2，同时保持数学和编程能力；实验显示RLVER在多方面提升对话能力。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升语言模型情感智能的有效途径，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Motivation: LLM在不可解或超出能力范围的问题上容易生成不可靠答案，严重影响其可靠性。此前研究主要集中在知识任务上，数学推理任务的可靠性尚未系统研究。

Method: 构建ReliableMath数据集，包含可解和不可解数学问题，并提出可靠提示和对齐策略以提升模型可靠性。

Result: 大模型在可靠提示下对不可解问题的可靠性有所提升，但仍不及可解问题；小模型表现较差，但通过对齐策略可显著提升可靠性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLM在数学推理任务中的可靠性问题，并提出有效方法提升小模型的可靠性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在低资源语言（如马耳他语）中仍存在社会偏见，尤其是性别偏见，这强化了社会刻板印象并忽略了性别多样性。

Method: 研究采用BERTu和mBERTu模型，将英语的去偏见方法（如Counterfactual Data Augmentation等）迁移到马耳他语中，并使用CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准进行评估。

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了多语言NLP开发中需要更包容的方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言中开发更有效的去偏见方法的必要性，并呼吁多语言NLP的包容性发展。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

Motivation: 随着语言模型在临床环境中的广泛应用，需要一种高效、可扩展的方法来评估其生成的医疗文本的准确性和安全性。

Result: MedVAL显著提高了评估性能（F1分数从66%提升至83%），并开源了代码、数据集和模型。

Conclusion: MedVAL展示了语言模型在医疗文本验证方面接近专家水平的能力，为临床集成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (

open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching
expert-level validation ability for medical text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链（CoT）如何影响推理模型对越狱攻击的脆弱性，以及如何通过操纵CoT阶段来操控模型行为。

Method: 通过分析DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型的激活空间，识别出一个线性方向（“谨慎”方向），并通过干预CoT阶段的激活来测试模型行为。

Result: 发现干预“谨慎”方向会增加模型的有害服从行为，且仅干预CoT阶段的激活即可控制最终输出。

Conclusion: 思维链（CoT）是推理模型中对抗性操纵的新目标，具有潜在的攻击价值。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

Motivation: LLMs在广泛应用中可能传递社会或认知偏见，影响人类决策，尤其在医疗和法律等高风险领域，需研究其偏见的严重性和缓解方法。

Method: 评估三种LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，量化其偏见（如情感改变、幻觉、首因偏见），并测试18种干预方法的有效性。

Result: LLMs在21.86%的情况下改变上下文情感，57.33%的情况下对截止日期后数据产生幻觉，5.94%的情况下表现首因偏见；针对性干预方法有效。

Conclusion: LLMs在高风险领域的使用需技术保障和用户中心干预，以解决其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索树邻接语法的数学实现，揭示其代数结构，简化系统假设。

Method: 使用两种组合图定义，证明邻接操作为预李操作并形成李代数。

Result: 数学形式能捕获TAG系统特性，无需额外假设如空邻接约束和特征TAG。

Conclusion: 该数学框架为树邻接语法提供了新的理论视角和简化工具。

Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars
using two combinatorial definitions of graphs. With this lens, we demonstrate
that the adjoining operation defines a pre-Lie operation and subsequently forms
a Lie algebra. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by showing how
one of our mathematical formulations of TAG captures properties of the TAG
system without needing to posit them as additional components of the system,
such as null-adjoining constraints and feature TAG.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KinyaColBERT的新型检索模型，针对低资源语言（如Kinyarwanda）的检索增强生成（RAG）系统，通过改进词级交互和形态学分词，显著提高了检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言中因语言覆盖不足和分词不当导致的检索准确性问题，同时降低RAG系统的部署成本。

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT模型，结合了查询与文档的延迟词级交互、基于形态学的分词以及双层Transformer编码，生成细粒度且自包含的上下文嵌入。

Result: 在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中，KinyaColBERT表现优于基线模型和主流商业文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: KinyaColBERT为低资源语言提供了可靠且经济的RAG解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

TL;DR: RefineX是一个通过程序化编辑任务实现大规模、精细化预训练数据优化的框架，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升预训练数据质量是优化大型语言模型性能的关键，但现有方法在效率和精细化方面存在不足。

Method: RefineX通过专家指导的端到端优化结果，提炼出最小化编辑删除程序，训练高效可靠的细化模型。

Result: RefineX在多个模型规模上表现优异，平均提升2.6%-7.2%，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: RefineX是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译方法难以有效捕捉语篇现象，导致翻译不连贯或不准确。

Method: 提出GRAFT框架，结合分段、有向无环图依赖建模和语篇感知翻译。

Result: 在多个翻译方向和领域上，GRAFT平均提升2.8 BLEU（IWSLT2017）和2.3 BLEU（英中翻译）。

Conclusion: GRAFT能有效处理语篇现象，生成连贯且准确的翻译。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

Result: 这些简单技术显著提升了模型的准确性，实现了多点的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类默读行为，LLMs能生成更合理的回答，更接近人类文本处理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Result: 在盲测集上CER/WER为11.76%，比官方基线提升8.41%。

Conclusion: SHNU-mASR系统在多语言语音识别任务中表现出色，无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on
sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in
trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading
strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本（MGT）泛滥的问题，现有检测器在通用任务上评估，难以适应维基百科编辑的实际需求。

Method: 提出WETBench基准测试，定义三种编辑任务（段落写作、摘要和文本风格转换），在多语言和多生成器环境下生成MGT，并评估多种检测器。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明检测器在现实场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 评估检测器时需使用多样化、任务特定的数据，以确保其在编辑驱动场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多语言上取得进展，但对低资源黏着语（如韩语）的效果仍有疑虑，尤其是复杂句尾结构。

Method: 构建KoSEnd数据集（3000句，标注15种句尾自然度），评估11种LLMs，分析参数量和预测一致性。

Result: 提示模型注意缺失句尾可显著提升性能，表明显式考虑语言特征的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在复杂语言结构（如韩语句尾）上的改进空间，显式提示有助于性能提升。

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Result: 实验表明LLMs能检测并纠正错误，但准确性和效率各异。

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以提高可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics
that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects.
Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that

Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果影响重大，但电子健康记录（EHR）中其结构化数据常不完整。

Method: 基于大型语言模型（LLMs）训练Flan-T5-Large，从法国临床笔记中提取SDoH，并评估其性能。

Result: 模型在部分SDoH类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）表现优异（F1>0.80），但在数据不足的类别表现较差。模型识别了95.8%的患者至少一个SDoH，远超结构化数据的2.8%。

Conclusion: NLP能有效提升非英语EHR系统中SDoH数据的完整性，但需解决标注不一致和模型泛化性问题。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究过于集中于英语，忽视了低资源语言的安全性，这与网络安全领域的‘最坏情况’准备原则相冲突。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 扩展现有对抗攻击方法至70种语言，评估单语和多语言LMs的安全性。

Result: 单语模型参数不足，安全性较差；多语言性有帮助，但不总能提升安全性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言社区中更安全部署LMs的重要考虑。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

TL;DR: 开发了一个多语言智能问答系统，将静态疫苗接种指南转化为交互式知识库，提升医疗专业人员获取信息的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗专业人员难以快速获取复杂疫苗接种指南的问题。

Method: 基于检索增强生成（RAG）框架和代理推理（Agentic RAG）开发系统。

Result: Agentic RAG在回答复杂或模糊问题时优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 系统通过移动应用实现实时访问，为临床提供高效支持。

Abstract: Vaccination plays a vital role in global public health, yet healthcare
professionals often struggle to access immunization guidelines quickly and
efficiently. National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive
and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially
during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a
multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static
vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base.
Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly
available on https://huggingface.co/VaxGuide

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字情感支持需求的增长，需要更严格的评估方法来衡量语言模型的共情能力和安全性。

Method: H2HTalk包含4,650个多样化场景，结合安全附件人格模块（SAP），对50个语言模型进行统一评估。

Result: 模型在长期规划和记忆保持方面表现不佳，尤其在用户需求隐含或变化时。

Conclusion: H2HTalk为情感智能伴侣提供了首个全面基准，并公开所有材料以促进安全心理支持模型的发展。

Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions
offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation
lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a
benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic
interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk
features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary
planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding
previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment
Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer
interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that
long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models
struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent
companions. We release all materials to advance development of LLMs capable of
providing meaningful and safe psychological support.

TL;DR: 研究舌癌手术后对发音清晰度和变异性的影响，发现术后清晰度在正常范围内，但变异性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨舌癌手术对舌头活动性和肌肉的影响，及其对发音清晰度和变异性的潜在影响。

Method: 使用句子朗读任务，通过VAI和VFD评估11名患者术前和术后6个月的数据，并与11名典型说话者对比。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低，但仍在正常范围内；术后/i/的VFD值增加，表明变异性提高。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度保持正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于偏好优化的方法，用于在神经机器翻译中解决术语歧义问题，利用人工后编辑数据提升术语准确性，同时保持翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实翻译场景中，术语通常存在多义性，且正确性依赖于上下文和公司风格指南。神经机器翻译系统难以处理此类问题，但公司环境中存在大量人工后编辑数据可用于学习。

Method: 采用偏好优化方法，利用术语后编辑数据作为偏好知识，结合监督微调和偏好优化目标（术语特定和完整序列目标）。

Result: 在英德后编辑数据上，该方法显著提升了术语准确性，且未显著降低COMET分数。

Conclusion: 该方法无需一对一术语词典或解码时人工干预，有效解决了术语歧义问题，并发布了相关测试集和术语词典。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

Motivation: 当前缺乏对双曲和欧几里得空间在多跳推理任务中的详细比较，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过简单整合双曲表示与编码器-解码器模型，进行对照实验比较两种空间的性能。

Result: 双曲空间在多种数据集上表现优于欧几里得空间，且可学习曲率初始化进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在多跳推理任务中更具优势，尤其适用于层次结构明显的数据集。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Method: 提出了一种终身学习方法，构建了包含维基数据快照和维基百科段落的数据集，并标注了相应的编辑操作。

Result: 生成了包含376K维基百科段落和1.25M知识图谱编辑操作的数据集，覆盖2019至2025年的10个维基数据快照。

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，同时公开了数据集和模型实现。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言数据稀缺对深度学习模型的限制。

Method: 采用RVC将音频样本转换为统一目标说话人，减少说话人相关变异性，突出方言特征。

Result: RVC单独使用提升分类性能，与其他增强方法结合效果更佳。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法设计选择多样但缺乏系统性研究，限制了未来发展。

Method: 分解数据剪枝为数据表示和选择算法，系统分析其对实例选择的影响。

Result: 更好的表示（如训练梯度）普遍提升选择效果；不同算法在不同场景下表现各异，且未必符合设计目标。

Conclusion: 数据表示对剪枝效果至关重要，选择算法需根据场景定制，并需严格评估其实际表现。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个模块化工具包，用于训练和推断时对Transformer模型进行可解释性分析，揭示传统标量指标忽略的语言特征获取现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有可解释性工具难以部署和维护的问题，提供轻量级的训练中分析能力。

Method: 结合ABSynth可控合成语料生成器，通过特征探测、内在维度分析等方法分析语言信号。

Result: 实验显示TRACE能揭示早期句法涌现、延迟语义获取等现象。

Conclusion: TRACE使Transformer分析更具可解释性、可操作性和可重复性。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

TL;DR: 提出了PFO数据集和RAV框架，用于更真实地评估LLM的事实核查能力，RAV在多个基准上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查评估数据集包含事后分析和标注线索，不适用于实时核查场景，需要更真实的评估方法。

Method: 构建PFO数据集（去除事后信息），并提出RAV框架（三代理迭代生成子问题验证声明）。

Result: RAV在RAWFC和HOVER基准上表现优于现有方法，PFO上性能下降最少（16.3%）。

Conclusion: PFO和RAV为事实核查提供了更真实的评估和改进方法，RAV在多领域表现优异。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

TL;DR: TACOS是一种创新的方法，通过结合开放标签和比较评分来选择指令微调（IFT）数据，解决了现有方法在数据多样性和质量评估上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据选择上存在多样性不足和质量评估标准不一致的问题，影响了指令微调的效果。

Method: TACOS利用大语言模型（LLMs）为人类查询分配开放标签，并通过归一化和聚类捕获数据多样性；同时采用比较评分方法在集群内评估样本相对质量。

Result: 实验表明，TACOS在多种数据集和LLM架构上大幅优于现有方法，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0上表现突出。

Conclusion: TACOS是一种高效且有效的IFT数据选择方法，显著提升了指令遵循性能。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非结构化源（如自由文本和科学文献）中提取结构化信息对加速科学发现至关重要，但现有LLMs在专业领域和跨任务泛化性上表现不佳。

Method: StructSense结合领域本体知识、自评估反馈循环和人工参与机制，提升信息提取效果。

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，克服了领域敏感性和跨任务泛化性不足的问题。

Conclusion: StructSense为结构化信息提取提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂领域。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）擅长慢速、深思熟虑的System 2思维，但缺乏快速、直觉的System 1思维，导致计算开销和延迟高。

Method: 通过识别控制快慢思维转换的向量，实现基于表示编辑的测试时缩放；结合实时难度估计，动态调整思考速度。

Result: 在无需训练或额外成本的情况下，平均提升1.3%的准确性，同时减少8.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该方法为LRMs提供了动态调整思维速度的插件式解决方案，有望支持更广泛的应用并启发未来研究。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs缺乏明确的内存管理系统，限制了其在长上下文推理、持续个性化和知识一致性方面的能力。现有方法（如RAG）是静态的，无法有效管理异构知识。

Method: 提出MemOS，将内存视为可管理系统资源，通过MemCube（封装内容和元数据）统一表示、调度和演化不同类型的内存。

Result: MemOS能够高效存储和检索内存，支持内存类型的灵活转换，为持续学习和个性化建模奠定基础。

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs提供了可控性、可塑性和可进化性，解决了内存管理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

Method: 利用Alpay代数和phi-infinity算子，构建函子系统，实现观察者（AI）与文本环境的协同演化。

Result: 证明了固定点的存在及其数学合理性、语义不变性和永久性，形成“共情嵌入”。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层面的对齐提供了严格的范畴论路径，对语义安全、符号记忆和自指理解有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

### [319] [OrthoRank: Token Selection via Sink Token Orthogonality for Efficient LLM inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03865)
*Seungjun Shin,Jaehoon Oh,Dokwan Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了注意力机制中的sink token现象，提出了一种动态选择重要token的方法OrthoRank，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索sink token与其他token的关系，并利用这一关系改进token选择方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态的相似性，提出OrthoRank方法，基于token向sink token移动的速度定义重要性。

Result: 实验显示OrthoRank在困惑度和零样本准确率上优于层剪枝方法，且在LongBench上表现更优。

Conclusion: OrthoRank是一种有效的动态token选择方法，能够提升模型性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset,
covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres.
Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize
a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This
fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In
conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction
capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further
enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related
applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型（LLMs）改变了技术对语言的影响方式，但其自我强化的训练循环可能导致语言多样性的丧失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何通过模型崩溃（model collapse）导致语言形式、语法特征和文化细微差别的消失。

Method: 结合计算机视觉、自然语言处理和机器翻译的研究，分析模型崩溃现象及其对语言分布尾部的影响。

Result: 语言多样性正在减少，尤其是分布尾部的语言形式和叙事。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新构想NLP领域，以保护和鼓励多语言表达的多样性和创造力。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

Method: 提出Easy Dataset框架，支持用户配置文本提取模型和分块策略，利用角色驱动提示生成多样化问答对，并通过可视化界面确保数据质量。

Result: 实验表明，在金融问答任务中，基于合成数据微调的LLM显著提升领域性能，同时保留通用知识。

Conclusion: Easy Dataset有效解决了领域数据稀缺问题，其开源代码已获得广泛关注。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at
https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub

Method: 引入Nunchi-Bench基准，评估LLMs对韩国文化的理解，包括事实知识、文化建议和情境解释。提出新的评估策略和评分指标。

Result: LLMs能识别事实信息，但在实际场景中应用困难。显性文化框架比语言提示更能提升表现。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench揭示了LLMs文化推理的局限性，并公开了基准和排行榜以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

TL;DR: AdaPCR通过建模段落间的依赖关系，改进检索增强生成（RAG）方法，在开放域问答中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法独立检索段落，导致冗余、噪声或多样性不足，尤其在噪声语料和多跳问题中表现不佳。

Method: 提出AdaPCR框架，将段落组合作为检索和重排单位，包括上下文感知查询重构和基于下游答案可能性的重排步骤。

Result: 实验表明AdaPCR在多个QA基准测试中优于基线，特别是在多跳推理任务中。

Conclusion: 建模段落间依赖关系能显著提升检索效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Abstract: Semantic map models represent meanings or functions as nodes in a graph
constrained by the local connectivity hypothesis, with edges indicating their
associations. Widely used in typological linguistics, these models compare
interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both
typologists and computational linguists. The system

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Savage Conversation Forests（SCF）的强化学习框架，用于优化大型语言模型在多轮对话任务中的表现，特别是在医疗诊断对话中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单轮任务优化方法（如DPO和GRPO）在多轮对话中表现不足，尤其是在需要理解早期对话对后续结果影响的场景（如医疗诊断对话）。

Method: SCF采用分支对话架构，生成多种可能的对话延续，以学习早期对话对后续互动和诊断结果的影响。

Result: 在模拟医患对话的实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性对话架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化复杂多轮对话任务的重要策略，SCF通过提供更丰富的跨轮次训练信号实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，BYOKG-RAG性能优于次优方法4.5%，且对自定义KG泛化性更好。

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG为KGQA提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案，并已开源。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在生成任务中表现优异，但容易产生幻觉（即事实错误的输出），需要一种无需参考的检测方法。

Method: 利用多个随机生成结果的token级概率方差，设计模型无关、可解释的检测框架。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集上验证，定量指标和可视化分析表明token级方差能可靠反映模型输出的不稳定性与幻觉模式。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现且适用于多领域，为LLMs生成可靠性提供了有价值的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多文化名称的多样性时表现不佳，尤其是在面对未见过的名称时。全球化背景下，准确识别多文化名称的需求日益增长。

Method: 采用Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning（PEFT）框架，结合对抗性数据增强和文化知识图谱，将名称识别任务转化为引导生成问题。

Result: PEFT方法在实验中表现优异，整体准确率达到93.1%，零样本名称识别准确率为89.5%，优于传统深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究在多文化名称识别领域取得了显著进展，提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注角色关系耗时且覆盖低，LLM输出常存在幻觉或逻辑不一致，需更高效可靠的方法。

Method: 结合LLM提取与符号推理，构建可编辑关系图，通过七类逻辑约束和交互界面实时验证与冲突解决。

Result: 实验表明SymbolicThought显著提升标注准确性和一致性，同时大幅降低时间成本。

Conclusion: SymbolicThought为叙事理解、可解释AI和LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示方法通常用无关标记初始化提示，而Context Tuning利用任务相关示例初始化，以提升少样本学习性能。

Method: Context Tuning通过任务相关示例初始化可训练提示或前缀，利用模型的上下文学习能力提取相关信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Context Tuning表现优于传统提示方法，且训练效率显著高于测试时训练。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且有效的少样本适应方法，优于传统提示方法。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在图书馆服务中是否能够公平服务所有用户，避免因训练数据中的社会偏见而损害图书馆的公平承诺。

Method: 通过提示六种先进的LLMs，模拟不同性别、种族/民族和机构角色的用户请求，评估其回应是否存在差异。

Result: LLMs在种族/民族上无差异，仅在一个模型中对女性有轻微偏见；对不同机构角色表现出适应性调整，反映专业规范而非歧视。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在学术图书馆参考服务中展现出支持公平和情境适当沟通的潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Motivation: 尽管东亚语言使用者众多，但其NLP数据集资源分散且研究不足，亟需系统性分析以促进高质量语言模型的发展。

Method: 通过定量和定性方法分析了HuggingFace生态系统中3,300多个数据集，比较了中文、日文和韩文数据集的特点。

Result: 发现中文数据集多为机构驱动，韩文数据集由社区主导，日文数据集则侧重于娱乐和亚文化。

Conclusion: 提出了改进数据集文档、许可清晰度和跨语言资源共享的策略，以推动东亚语言NLP的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

Result: 发现仇恨言论定义和审核实践存在显著不一致，且与研究努力脱节。

Conclusion: 建议进一步探索结合多种策略的自动化仇恨言论审核统一框架。

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

Result: 模型在分类风险促进和健康支持情感上表现良好，但准确性因平台、议题和模型类型而异，且对中性消息检测存在挑战。

Conclusion: 选择验证语言模型时需谨慎，考虑训练数据潜在偏见对结果的影响。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Method: 采用持续预训练、指令微调和规则强化学习等方法，在不同数据源（短/长CoT样本）上训练模型。

Result: 持续预训练对泛化有一定帮助，指令微调效果有限甚至有害，长CoT和规则强化学习显著提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 长推理链结合自反思是提升泛化推理能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为研究人员和政策制定者提供了一种轻量级、易访问的工具，解决了从大型数据集中提取R/S相关信息的挑战。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

Conclusion: RAT结合了循环和注意力的优势，在长上下文任务中实现了高效与性能的平衡，混合架构进一步优化了局部和全局建模。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，GradOT在隐私保护和模型性能上优于现有OT方法。

Conclusion: GradOT为离线调优提供了理论基础，并为大规模LLMs提供了一种无需训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内部和外部推理路径，有效提升了多模态讽刺检测的准确性，即使外部推理偶尔存在噪声，仍能提供有价值的指导。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Method: DMDP采用模态特定的深度提示，结合提示共享机制和跨模态对齐模块，实现分层特征学习和多模态交互。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，DMDP在少样本和极低资源设置下表现优异，且跨数据集评估显示其泛化能力强。

Conclusion: DMDP在少样本多模态讽刺检测中表现优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

*Zhen Xiong,Yujun Cai,Zhecheng Li,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$S^3$的新框架，用于解决扩散语言模型（dLLMs）在可控生成中的挑战，显著提升了结构一致性、内容保真度并减少了幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本生成中展现出潜力，但现有方法在可控生成上面临序列长度敏感性、高幻觉率和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出$S^3$框架，通过将目标模式结构注入输出上下文，减少不必要计算并提升可控性。

Result: 实验表明，$S^3$在结构一致性上提升65%，内容保真度提升48%，幻觉率降低17%。

Conclusion: $S^3$为扩散模型在可控文本生成中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sahil Danayak,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdS（Adapter-State Sharing）是一种轻量级框架，用于多模态图像-文本讽刺检测，通过共享适配器状态和仅在上层插入适配器，显著减少了可训练参数，同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限环境下多模态讽刺检测的挑战，避免现有方法因完全微调大型预训练模型而不适用于低资源设置的问题。

Method: 基于CLIP构建的AdS框架，仅在上层插入适配器，并引入文本适配器指导视觉适配器的共享机制，促进跨模态学习。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS使用显著更少的可训练参数，实现了优于现有PEFT和完全微调方法的结果。

Conclusion: AdS为资源受限环境下的多模态讽刺检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

### [352] [DP-Fusion: Token-Level Differentially Private Inference for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04531)
*Rushil Thareja,Preslav Nakov,Praneeth Vepakomma,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-Fusion是一种差分隐私推理机制，用于保护大语言模型（LLM）生成输出中的敏感信息，通过分组和混合输出分布实现隐私与效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保护上下文隐私时缺乏形式化保证或隐私/效用权衡不佳，DP-Fusion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DP-Fusion将敏感令牌分组，对每组运行LLM，并混合输出分布以控制隐私泄露。

Result: 该方法通过参数ε灵活控制隐私与效用，但需多次LLM前向传递。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion为LLM提供了形式化隐私保证，同时允许隐私与效用的精细权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Motivation: 解决现代LLM开发中双脚本语言适应问题，填补埃及方言领域的空白。

Method: 采用Branch-Train-MiX策略合并脚本专家，构建MoE模型。

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及评估基准上显著优于LLaMa等模型，12B模型在拉丁脚本任务上性能提升14.4%。

Conclusion: 该工作为双脚本语言LLM适应提供了全面方法，资源已公开。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM个性化方法缺乏统一理论框架，无法系统理解个性化驱动因素。

Method: 整合认知双记忆模型，提出PRIME框架，结合情景记忆（用户历史互动）和语义记忆（长期信念），并引入慢思考策略。

Result: 实验证明PRIME在长短上下文场景中均有效，能捕捉动态个性化，超越流行度偏差。

Conclusion: PRIME为LLM个性化提供了统一框架，实验验证其有效性，填补了理论和数据集的空白。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

*Matteo Guida,Yulia Otmakhova,Eduard Hovy,Lea Frermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算框架，用于分析新闻文章和读者评论中的框架效应，发现框架在评论中的重复使用与新闻来源高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索新闻框架如何被公众重新组织，而现有NLP方法往往忽略了这一点。

Method: 方法包括细化框架标签、从句子级预测重构主导框架，并将文章与相关评论对齐。

Result: 研究发现框架在评论中的重复使用与新闻来源高度相关，但主题模式各异。

Conclusion: 结论是框架在公众理解新闻时具有动态性，研究提供了分类器、标注数据集和预测数据集。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM提供了一种轻量级、可解释的自我校正框架，有效减少了事实错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful yet prone to generating factual
errors, commonly referred to as hallucinations. We present a lightweight,
interpretable framework for knowledge-aware self-correction of LLM outputs

fine-tuning, our method post-processes model outputs and corrects factual
inconsistencies via external semantic memory. We demonstrate the approach using
DistilGPT-2 and show promising results on simple factual prompts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EI-BERT的超轻量级BERT框架，通过跨蒸馏方法压缩模型，解决了移动计算环境下NLP模型的资源限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动计算时代，资源受限的边缘设备需要高效、隐私合规且支持多任务的NLP模型，但现有模型难以满足这些需求。

Method: EI-BERT采用硬令牌剪枝、跨蒸馏和参数量化等技术，通过跨蒸馏方法实现高效知识传递。

Result: 实验表明，EI-BERT仅1.91 MB，是目前最小的NLU任务模型，并已成功应用于支付宝生态系统。

Conclusion: EI-BERT在资源受限环境下表现优异，已实际部署于支付宝的实时边缘推荐系统。

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

TL;DR: 论文提出R1-RE框架，通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）改进关系抽取任务，显著提升域外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关系抽取方法在域外泛化上表现不佳，受人类标注流程启发，将其重构为基于标注指南的推理任务。

Method: 引入R1-RE框架，利用小语言模型的推理能力进行标注任务，结合强化学习与可验证奖励。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型域外准确率达70%，媲美GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为关系抽取任务提供了新的训练动态和推理行为洞察，显著提升域外鲁棒性。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Abstract: To leverage the advantages of LLM in addressing challenges in the Text-to-SQL
task, we present XiYan-SQL, an innovative framework effectively generating and
utilizing multiple SQL candidates. It consists of three components: 1) a Schema
Filter module filtering and obtaining multiple relevant schemas; 2) a
multi-generator ensemble approach generating multiple highquality and diverse
SQL queries; 3) a selection model with a candidate reorganization strategy
implemented to obtain the optimal SQL query. Specifically, for the
multi-generator ensemble, we employ a multi-task fine-tuning strategy to
enhance the capabilities of SQL generation models for the intrinsic alignment
between SQL and text, and construct multiple generation models with distinct
generation styles by fine-tuning across different SQL formats. The experimental
results and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
of our framework. Overall, XiYan-SQL achieves a new SOTA performance of 75.63%
on the notable BIRD benchmark, surpassing all previous methods. It also attains

Motivation: 现有研究未探索电商评论中情感检测与解释性文本识别的联合任务，无法理解触发顾客情感的具体原因。

Method: 提出EOT联合任务，基于Plutchik的8种基本情感理论，标注数据集EOT-X，并开发框架EOT-DETECT，评估23种大语言模型。

Result: EOT-DETECT框架在零样本和思维链技术上表现优越，跨电商领域适用。

Conclusion: EOT任务和框架填补了研究空白，为理解顾客情感触发因素提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across
e-commerce domains.

Conclusion: LOOM-Scope为长上下文模型的评估提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context processing has become a fundamental capability for large
language models~(LLMs). To assess model's long-context performance, numerous
long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

Method: 引入MS-Q2P数据集，利用LLMs生成表格形式的比较摘要，并通过M-OS降低延迟。

Result: M-OS比直接输入方法减少40%延迟，QF-CES-PROMPT评估显示与人类判断相关性达0.74。

Conclusion: QF-CES方法在生成和评估比较摘要方面具有潜力，且高效、个性化。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Motivation: 探究自监督语音模型（如Wav2vec 2.0）是否能够学习并区分不同语言中的单词重音特征，尤其是可变重音语言与固定重音语言之间的差异。

Method: 在五种语言（荷兰语、英语、德语、匈牙利语和波兰语）上训练诊断性重音分类器，分析模型嵌入的重音表示，并测试其语言特异性。

Result: 分类器能高精度区分重音与非重音音节；重音表示具有语言特异性，可变重音语言与固定重音语言之间的差异更显著。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型能有效学习语言特定的单词重音表示，且可变重音语言与固定重音语言的重音特征差异明显。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犹太-阿拉伯语转写为阿拉伯字母存在挑战，如字母映射模糊、拼写不一致和频繁的希伯来语-阿拉姆语代码切换。

Method: 采用两步法：字符级映射和后校正，以解决语法和拼写错误。

Result: 首次对LLMs在此任务上的表现进行了基准评估，并证明转写使阿拉伯NLP工具能够进行形态句法标注和机器翻译。

Conclusion: 转写犹太-阿拉伯语为阿拉伯字母是可行的，且为NLP工具的应用提供了可能性。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多源意见摘要中的潜力，并填补评估数据集的空白。

Method: 引入M-OS-EVAL数据集，评估多源意见摘要的7个关键维度。

Result: M-OS显著提升用户参与度，87%用户偏好M-OS摘要；M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断相关性更高（Spearman=0.74）。

Conclusion: M-OS通过结合多源信息生成更全面的摘要，提升用户决策体验。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Conclusion: 记忆标签噪声是基于而非覆盖底层推理机制，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to
produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and
contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and
entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has
received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is
currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area.
To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun
generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional
approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models.
Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research
challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: Spec-TOD在低资源场景下具有潜力，推动高效任务导向对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA提供了高效的数据生成和训练解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Result: 模型收敛并生成连贯文本，在MMLU基准上优于传统可训练嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 高层语义是Transformer架构和数据规模的涌现属性，嵌入层角色应从语义容器重构为结构基元。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个能够可靠自动化评估人类感知质量的框架，为开发以用户为中心的生成模型提供了可扩展且准确的工具。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt

Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Conclusion: 研究为不同LLMs在任务类型中的行为提供了实用见解，推动了基于指令的高效NLP系统研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

*Jaewook Lee,Alexander Scarlatos,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的可解释生成框架，用于帮助罗马字母背景的学习者记忆日语词汇，特别是复杂的汉字（Kanji）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语汉字因其复杂性和数量庞大，对学习者构成挑战。现有的大语言模型（LLM）方法缺乏可解释性，无法系统化生成助记词。

Method: 提出了一种生成框架，明确建模助记词构建过程，并通过一种新颖的期望最大化算法学习规则。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在新学习者冷启动场景下表现良好，并揭示了有效助记词生成的机制。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了助记词生成的可解释性和系统性，还为学习者提供了更有效的记忆工具。

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的能力及其滥用问题，提出了区分人类与机器生成文本（Task-A）及识别生成模型（Task-B）的方法，基于GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs生成文本的能力被滥用于钓鱼邮件、假新闻等，且检测难度增加，需开发有效区分方法。

Method: 基于GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT的微调，分别完成Task-A（区分人类与机器文本）和Task-B（识别生成模型）。

Result: 微调后的GPT_4o-mini和BERT在Task-A上准确率达0.9547，Task-B为0.4698。

Conclusion: 微调模型能有效区分人类与机器生成文本，但识别具体生成模型仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过干预前向传递或正则化反向传播，鼓励语言模型在训练后阶段更有效地利用预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练后方法（如监督微调）未能充分利用预训练阶段获取的知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 将FFN层视为关联键值记忆，通过前向干预或反向传播正则化促进记忆向量的使用。

Result: 在15个下游任务中表现一致提升，且模型能自适应分配信息，更关注语义重要标记。

Conclusion: 训练后阶段未充分利用预训练潜力，通过潜在表示空间干预可提升性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强大的共情LSLM模型多为封闭式，缺乏透明性，阻碍了研究进展。OpenS2S旨在填补这一空白，推动共情语音系统的开放研究。

Method: 基于BLSP-Emo模型，采用流式交错解码架构实现低延迟语音生成，并利用自动化数据构建流程合成高质量共情对话数据。

Result: OpenS2S实现了低延迟的共情语音生成，并提供了丰富的训练语料和开源资源。

Conclusion: OpenS2S为共情语音系统的研究提供了透明、可扩展的工具，有望加速该领域的创新。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合直接偏好优化（DPO）和课程学习的新框架，用于生成可靠的新闻解释，特别针对印地语等低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等低资源语言生成可靠的新闻解释至关重要，但目前缺乏自动化工具。

Method: 通过整合DPO和课程学习，以事实核查的解释作为首选响应，LLM输出作为非首选响应，并引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化DPO损失函数。

Result: 实验证明该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（如Mistral、Llama、mBART等）。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至低资源语言，有效对抗错误信息。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种新颖的奖励建模方法，通过策略判别器量化策略差异，显著提升奖励模型性能，并在多个任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，POLAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出POLAR预训练方法，训练奖励模型以区分相同和不同策略，捕捉策略间的相对差异。

Result: POLAR显著提升性能，如STEM任务准确率从54.8%提升至81.0%，并在RLHF中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR是一种有前景的通用奖励模型开发方向，具有高性能和良好的扩展性。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文启动（contextual priming）中的漏洞，并提出了一种名为“响应攻击”（Response Attack）的方法，利用辅助LLM生成有害内容以引导目标模型。该方法在多个LLMs中表现优于现有攻击技术，并提出了缓解措施。


<details>

Motivation: 研究LLMs在上下文启动中的潜在漏洞，以揭示其可能被滥用的风险。

Method: 提出“响应攻击”（Response Attack），利用辅助LLM生成有害响应，并通过触发提示引导目标模型生成违规内容。

Result: 在8个开源和专有LLMs中，该方法攻击成功率高于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过构建上下文感知的安全微调数据集，显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保留了模型能力。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注推理、规划和执行能力，而记忆能力的评估因缺乏相关基准而被忽视。

Method: 结合现有数据集和新构建的数据集，设计MemoryAgentBench，覆盖四个记忆核心能力。

Result: 实验表明当前方法在四个能力上均表现不足，需进一步研究。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench为LLM代理的记忆能力提供了系统化评估工具，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a

This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that

Motivation: 手动设计系统指令资源密集且效果不佳，现有自动化方法牺牲可读性。

Conclusion: SI-Agent在性能和可读性间取得平衡，有望推动LLM定制化和透明度，但计算成本和反馈可靠性仍需改进。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

Result: 在SAP数据集上表现优异，性能提升15%和4.35%，成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 验证了GraphRAG在大规模企业应用中的可行性，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

*Jianyu Zhang,Léon Bottou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory Mosaics v2 在大型语言模型规模（如 llama-8B）和真实数据集上保持了其组合性和上下文学习能力，显著优于传统 Transformer 模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证 Memory Mosaics 在更大规模和真实数据集上的表现，并探索其是否能在新任务推理中超越 Transformer。

Method: 将 Memory Mosaics 扩展到 10B 规模，训练 1 万亿 token，引入架构改进（v2），并评估其在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度的能力。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2 在训练知识学习上与 Transformer 相当，但在新任务推理（新知识存储和上下文学习）上显著优于 Transformer，且无法通过增加 Transformer 的训练数据轻易复现。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2 在大型模型和真实数据上表现出色，尤其在新任务推理方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

*Anand Gokhale,Vaibhav Srivastava,Francesco Bullo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，结合LLM的推理能力和形式逻辑的保证，通过LTL约束指导LLM行为，提高长期规划任务的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长期规划任务中容易累积错误，导致不安全或低效行为，限制了其通用性。

Method: 使用LTLCrit作为轨迹级LLM批评者，通过LTL约束指导LLM演员，支持固定和自适应约束。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘任务中实现100%完成率，并提高了效率。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种强大且灵活的安全决策范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector
embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our
methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured
knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We
employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the
FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective
optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

*Franklin Mingzhe Li,Kaitlyn Ng,Bin Zhu,Patrick Carrington*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSCAR利用对象状态识别技术，为非视觉烹饪提供实时步骤跟踪支持，通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对视力障碍者具有挑战性，现有系统缺乏对对象状态的跟踪和反馈支持。

Method: OSCAR整合食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，实现实时步骤跟踪。

Result: 实验表明对象状态显著提升步骤预测准确性，并揭示了影响性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: OSCAR为非视觉烹饪提供了有效的上下文感知支持，并贡献了数据集和设计见解。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

Conclusion: DiaFORGE为构建可靠的企业级工具调用代理提供了实用方案，并开源了相关数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

TL;DR: iSelf-Discover框架的动态结构化JSON推理与非结构化推理相比，非结构化推理在复杂任务中表现更优，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究结构化输出与非结构化推理在LLM中的性能差异，解决结构化推理的计算成本和忠实性问题。

Method: 引入iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化JSON推理与非结构化推理进行对比。

Result: 非结构化推理在MATH基准测试中性能提升18.90%，零样本非结构化推理优于五样本结构化推理。

Conclusion: 非结构化推理在复杂问题解决中更具优势，需重新评估结构化格式的依赖和复合系统的组织方式。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Conclusion: 本文为研究人员利用AI/ML克服瓶颈、加速药物发现提供了重要指导。

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Conclusion: 建议AI研究应避免历史错误，并提出具体步骤以推动科学严谨的研究进展。

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

Result: 在疾病分类任务中性能接近专家方法（AUC差异-0.004），6/9疾病类型的召回率提升。

Conclusion: MESHAgents提供可扩展的自动化方案，生成临床相关表型，透明且高效。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Result: 提出了一个理论框架、成熟度模型，并明确了监督与控制的应用边界和局限性。

Conclusion: 明确监督与控制的区分有助于实践和监管，但现有方法仍有不足，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效表示和学习接近最优的任务分配策略，适用于不同维度的状态和动作空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为无限状态和动作空间的动态任务分配问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Motivation: 解决在ORAN架构中，传统RAG方法缺乏系统性评估的问题，尤其是在高风险的电信领域。

Method: 采用Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG，基于ORAN规范进行对比评估，使用生成指标（如忠实性、答案相关性、上下文相关性和事实正确性）衡量性能。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现优于传统RAG，Hybrid GraphRAG在事实正确性上提升8%，GraphRAG在上下文相关性上提升7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中具有显著优势，尤其在事实正确性和上下文相关性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化工作流和优化算法，有效解决了MAS的动态演化和性能优化问题，并在多个任务中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

*Rebekah A. Gelpí,Eric Xue,William A. Cunningham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）和贝叶斯逆规划模型的混合方法，用于机器心智理论（ToM）任务，以提升推理能力和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯逆规划模型在复杂场景下扩展性不足，而LLMs在ToM任务中表现不稳定。结合两者优势以提升性能。

Method: 使用LLMs生成假设和似然函数，结合贝叶斯逆规划模型计算后验概率，预测智能体的心理状态。

Result: 在ToM任务中表现优于单独使用LLMs或链式思维提示的方法，即使是较小的LLMs也能取得较好效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为ToM模型的未来发展和社会智能生成代理的创建提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

TL;DR: Tunsr是一个统一的神经符号推理框架，用于知识图谱推理，通过结合神经和符号方法的优势，解决多样化推理场景的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要集中于单一形式的神经或符号推理，未能有效整合两者的优势，且难以满足多样化推理任务的需求。

Method: Tunsr引入一致的推理图结构，通过前向逻辑消息传递机制更新节点表示和注意力，并提出FARI算法归纳一阶逻辑规则。

Result: 在19个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tunsr在四种推理场景中均表现有效。

Conclusion: Tunsr成功整合了神经和符号方法，为多样化知识图谱推理任务提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Method: 提出整合LLMs的路线图，并通过计算生物学案例（HIV反弹动力学）展示其应用。

Result: LLMs在人类监督下能促进跨学科合作与研究。

Conclusion: 负责任地使用LLMs将推动创新跨学科研究并加速科学发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过基于代理的架构增强LLM问答系统的推理能力，自动解决问题的模糊或不完整性，从而缩短交互时间并提高答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM问答系统在长对话中可能因上下文不明确而效率低下，需要多轮交互。研究旨在通过代理架构自动解决这些问题。

Method: 使用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，通过分类、解决和回答三个动作处理问题的不完整性或模糊性。

Result: 实验显示代理架构能缩短交互时间、提高答案质量，并解释问题的缺陷，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 代理架构在大多数情况下优于传统方法，尤其适用于问题上下文不足的场景，有助于构建更健壮的问答系统。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Result: 进化出的代理在击败初始Boss时达到35%的成功率。

Conclusion: 视觉神经进化在复杂游戏环境中具有潜力，尤其适用于缺乏API支持的情况。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理和大型语言模型的框架，用于在组织中重建隐性知识，通过模拟SI传播过程，实现了94.9%的知识召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织中隐性知识的记录存在挑战，如信息不完整、难以识别专家、正式与非正式网络的交互等。

Method: 利用代理和大型语言模型，通过员工交互迭代重建知识描述，模拟SI传播过程进行864次仿真。

Result: 代理实现了94.9%的知识召回率，自我反馈与外部文献评分高度相关，且无需直接访问领域专家。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕获分散知识，应对组织复杂性。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

TL;DR: 论文提出RELRaE框架，利用大语言模型从XML数据中提取关系标签，支持实验室自动化中的知识图谱生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室机器人产生的XML数据需要转换为知识图谱以实现数据互操作性，关键步骤是丰富XML模式以构建本体模式。

Method: 使用RELRaE框架，通过大语言模型在不同阶段提取和准确标记XML模式中的隐含关系。

Result: 研究表明大语言模型能有效生成关系标签，支持半自动本体生成框架。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在实验室自动化和半自动本体生成框架中具有重要价值。

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于经济约束的LLM评估框架，通过量化错误成本、延迟成本和放弃查询成本，将性能权衡转化为单一数值。研究发现，在错误成本超过0.01美元时，推理模型更具优势；当错误成本低至0.1美元时，单个大型LLM优于级联模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法无法比较具有不同优缺点的LLM的问题，为实际应用中的性能权衡提供经济角度的量化依据。

Method: 提出经济评估框架，将性能权衡转化为基于美元的经济约束（错误成本、延迟成本、放弃查询成本），并应用于MATH基准测试中的推理与非推理模型比较。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；单个大型LLM在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先使用最强大的模型，而非最小化部署成本，因为AI错误的经济影响远大于部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uni-Retrieval和Uni-RAG通过多模态检索和生成技术提升教育内容检索和生成的效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统难以处理教育场景中的多样性和模糊性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发Uni-Retrieval模块和Uni-RAG管道，结合MoE-LoRA和指令调优语言模型。

Result: 在SER等基准测试中表现优于基线系统，检索和生成质量更高且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种黑盒测试技术，通过差异测试区分自主代理行为错误是源于代理缺陷还是环境不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理及其环境复杂性增加，识别错误来源变得困难但对可靠部署至关重要。

Method: AIProbe生成多样化环境配置和任务，使用拉丁超立方采样修改参数，并通过独立于代理的搜索规划器解决任务，对比代理与规划器表现以识别错误来源。

Result: 评估显示AIProbe在检测总错误和独特错误方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于自主代理的可靠部署。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工神经网络（尤其是LLMs）是否能解释人类认知的原始表征和组合规则，特别是在抽象认知功能（如语言和逻辑）领域。

Method: 通过四个实验，测试多种LLMs在逻辑规则归纳任务中的表现，并与pLoT模型进行对比。

Result: LLMs在拟合人类行为方面与pLoT模型相当甚至更优，且预测的规则性质不同，表明LLMs并非pLoT的简单实现。

Conclusion: LLMs可能为人类逻辑概念的解释提供新的理论框架，值得未来认知科学研究关注。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基础和基准。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

### [426] [CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928)
*Yiliu Sun,Zicheng Zhao,Sheng Wan,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CortexDebate的新方法，通过稀疏辩论图和MDM模块解决多智能体辩论中的输入过长和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一大语言模型（LLM）存在幻觉和推理能力不足的问题，多智能体辩论（MAD）虽有效但面临输入过长和过度自信的挑战。

Method: CortexDebate构建稀疏辩论图，每个LLM智能体仅与对其有帮助的智能体辩论，并通过MDM模块优化图结构。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上验证了CortexDebate的有效性。

Conclusion: CortexDebate显著提升了多智能体辩论的效果，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

*Mohimenul Kabir,Kuldeep S Meel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUS-ASP是一个基于答案集编程的框架，用于在线枚举最小不可满足子集（MUS），在性能和效率上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不可满足公式的核心原因是关键，当前研究集中在枚举和计数MUS。

Method: 通过将MUS枚举问题转化为答案集求解问题，利用ASP的计算效率。

Result: 实验表明MUS-ASP在枚举和计数任务中表现高效，尤其在混合求解器中。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP是一个高效的工具，特别适合复杂组合问题的MUS枚举和计数。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

### [428] [Toward Better Generalisation in Uncertainty Estimators: Leveraging Data-Agnostic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03998)
*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征来提升大型语言模型（LLM）不确定性量化的泛化能力，但结果并不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成高置信度但不准确回答的问题，需改进不确定性量化方法，尤其是跨任务或跨领域的泛化能力。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，并筛选最具信息量的隐藏状态特征，以评估混合特征对泛化性能的影响。

Result: 实验显示数据无关特征通常能提升泛化性能，但在某些情况下会降低性能；筛选隐藏状态特征也未一致提升效果。

Conclusion: 数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征的结合效果因情况而异，部分原因是训练探针低估了数据无关特征的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities
across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized
by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense
solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior
semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search
and optimization capability of genetic algorithms, we propose to capitalize on
their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic
algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its
performance.

Method: 开发了J1-ENVS（动态法律环境）和J1-EVAL（评估框架），并在17个LLM代理上进行实验。

Result: 许多模型具备法律知识，但在动态环境中的程序执行表现不佳，GPT-4o总体表现低于60%。

Conclusion: 动态法律智能仍面临挑战，研究结果为未来方向提供了参考。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

TL;DR: HAWK是一个模块化框架，解决多智能体系统中的互操作性、任务调度和资源共享问题，通过分层设计和标准化接口提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统在跨平台互操作性、动态任务调度和资源共享方面存在挑战，缺乏标准化接口和灵活的协作框架。

Method: 提出HAWK框架，包含五层（用户、工作流、操作、智能体、资源）和十六个标准化接口，支持任务解析、工作流编排、智能调度等。

Result: 通过CreAgentive原型验证，HAWK在吞吐量、调用复杂性和系统可控性方面表现优异，支持大语言模型的灵活集成。

Conclusion: HAWK展示了在多领域的应用潜力，未来研究方向包括幻觉缓解、实时性能优化和跨域适应性提升。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

Motivation: 开源LLM网页代理与闭源系统的差距扩大，主要受限于单步任务局限性和高计算成本。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先通过监督微调（SFT）训练学生模型模仿教师模型，再进行策略强化学习（RL）。通过1,370种配置采样和自举法优化超参数。

Result: 结合SFT和RL的方法在WorkArena和MiniWob++上表现优于单独使用任一方法，计算成本降低55%，性能接近闭源模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了开源LLM网页代理的性能，优化了计算资源使用，缩小了与闭源系统的差距。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for

challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective
alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing

Method: 通过热力学类比（Mpemba效应）分析“谷-河”损失景观，推导最优平台学习率及其存在条件。

Result: 发现存在一个最优平台学习率（强Mpemba点），能加速收敛，并提供了保留其优势的衰减动态估计。

Conclusion: 研究为基于平台的学习率调度提供了理论依据，并指导LLM学习率调优，减少超参数搜索。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust

teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

TL;DR: SmartThinker是一个两阶段学习框架，通过细粒度控制推理链长度，减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中存在冗余和低效问题，全局长度惩罚方法会导致关键推理步骤过度压缩或保留不必要的细节。

Method: SmartThinker采用两阶段方法：1）通过拒绝采样和监督微调（SFT）适应短推理模式；2）通过SCPO（步级长度控制策略优化）优化模型输出分布。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SmartThinker显著减少了冗余推理，性能与现有方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过细粒度控制推理链长度，实现了效率与准确性的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Conclusion: WebSynthesis为代理的自我改进提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOD-X是一个新型的模块化开放去中心化交换框架，旨在解决异构智能体间的互操作性问题，通过分层架构、通用消息总线、状态管理和区块链安全机制实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统从单一模型发展为专业化智能体生态系统，标准化通信协议的需求日益迫切。

Method: 提出MOD-X框架，包括通用消息总线、状态管理、翻译能力和区块链安全机制，支持发布-订阅通信模型、语义能力发现和动态工作流编排。

Result: MOD-X能够有效集成异构智能体（如基于规则的系统、神经网络、符号推理引擎等），无需中心化协调即可实现去中心化互操作。

Conclusion: MOD-X为去中心化、可扩展的智能体生态系统提供了理论与实践结合的解决方案。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba和线性Transformer的双通道时间序列预测模型DC-Mamber，结合了局部和全局特征建模的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Transformer和Mamba）在时间序列预测中各有局限，Transformer全局依赖强但计算复杂度高，Mamba计算高效但全局信息聚合能力弱。

Method: DC-Mamber采用双通道设计：Mamba通道提取变量内特征（channel-independent），Transformer通道建模跨时间步全局依赖（channel-mixing）。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验表明，DC-Mamber的预测精度优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber通过结合Mamba和Transformer的优势，实现了高效且准确的时间序列预测。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中因事实错误而受限，现有方法未充分利用token和layer的联合动态。

Method: 提出token感知、layer定位的对比解码方法，通过分析注意力模式，抑制特定token在特定层的注意力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需额外训练或模型修改，能显著提升多种大语言模型的事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合动态优化，有效提升生成内容的事实性，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于现有方法，推荐更个性化和准确。

Conclusion: ARMR通过时间学习和动态机制，有效提升了药物推荐的性能。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in
serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation
remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with
human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language

then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

Result: Deja Vu表现为抽象和空间语言，不自主自传体记忆富含个人情感细节，意外思维则具有不可预测性和认知干扰。

Conclusion: 语言分析能够揭示自发认知状态的表达方式，为相关理论提供新视角。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Conclusion: TRAP在噪声鲁棒性和泛化性上表现优异，为自动驾驶异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏生物智能的核心特性，如快速持续学习、基于感知运动的表征和结构化知识。受神经科学启发，研究提出千脑系统以模仿大脑皮层柱的架构。

Conclusion: 千脑系统是一种有前景的AI新方法，Monty的初步成果支持其在快速学习和高效推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Motivation: 由于法规和技术限制，推荐系统仅能获取群体偏好数据，如何在保护隐私的同时实现个性化推荐成为挑战。

Method: 引入Rec-APC模型，基于用户类型的先验分布，通过贝叶斯更新动态调整推荐策略，使用分支定界算法计算最优策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在用户类型较多时优于POMDP求解器SARSOP，且策略能快速收敛为纯利用。

Conclusion: Rec-APC模型为聚合偏好数据下的决策提供了有效解决方案，并启发了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

Result: 最佳情况下，PETs将攻击风险降低了49.47%，同时保持了模型效用和解释质量。

Conclusion: 研究提出了在XAI中使用PETs的策略，以最大化隐私保护效果并最小化攻击成功率。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Result: 实证研究表明，这些原则在生物和人工智能系统中具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: “核心与外围”原则为智能系统的工程化提供了新的理论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

Method: 设计了时间解耦模块，分别捕获尺度共享和尺度特定的时序表示，并引入两种正则化项以确保共享表示的一致性和特定表示的差异性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DisMS-TS优于现有基线方法，最高准确率提升达9.71%。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过解耦多尺度特征，有效解决了冗余共享特征问题，显著提升了时间序列分类的性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少LLM推理次数并加速训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS提供了一种高效且计算成本低的提示选择方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRS）中存在极端长尾分布问题，导致对高频热门项目的偏好，牺牲了多样性并加剧冷启动问题。

Method: LumiCRS采用三层策略：(i) 自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）动态调整权重；(ii) 原型学习稳定表示；(iii) GPT-4o驱动的对话增强模块生成多样化对话片段。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10提升了7-15%，人类评估也显示其流畅性、信息量和长尾相关性更优。

Conclusion: 多层协作策略有效解决了长尾问题，构建了高效且公平的对话推荐系统。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1是一种基于分层奖励的强化学习框架，用于训练LLM生成功能正确且PPA优化的RTL代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法同时优化功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种新方法。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最先进的功能正确性，部分设计超越人工编写的PPA指标。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合工具链反馈可有效生成优于人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

*Seyedarmin Azizi,Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Massoud Pedram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASC的推理时技术，通过调整隐藏表示来压缩冗长的思维链（CoTs），从而减少上下文浪费和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链（CoTs）虽然有助于复杂推理，但往往过于冗长，导致资源浪费。作者观察到冗长和简洁的CoTs在模型激活空间中占据不同区域，希望通过调整激活向量来优化推理过程。

Method: 提出ASC技术，通过提取和注入“转向向量”来压缩CoTs，无需重新训练模型。理论分析基于KL散度约束调节转向强度。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上，ASC实现了67.43%的CoT长度压缩，同时保持准确性，并在8B模型上平均加速2.73倍。

Conclusion: ASC是一种高效且无需训练的方法，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的推理场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Method: JARVIS采用两阶段框架：专家LLM翻译查询为指令，代理执行数据检索和响应生成，结合自适应上下文注入、参数化SQL构建和自底向上规划。

Result: JARVIS在真实HVAC数据和专家QA数据集上表现优异，响应质量和准确性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: JARVIS为HVAC系统交互提供了高效、准确的解决方案，适用于多样化查询。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and
requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore
how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Result: 评估了三种先进LLM和两种机器学习模型，表现最佳的LLM与最准确的机器学习模型精度相当。

Conclusion: LLM在交通事件影响预测中具有实际可行性。

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Conclusion: DoPI系统有效结合多轮对话和专业知识，为中医诊断提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

Motivation: 解决交通事故严重性预测中数据不完整、特征依赖性强、类别不平衡等问题，同时提升模型的扩展性和可解释性。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，每个智能体专注于特定特征子集（如空间、环境、时间），结合规则和LLM引导的共识机制进行预测。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE的准确率接近90%，显著优于传统机器学习方法和现有提示推理方法。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索IL和RL在手术动作规划中的表现差异，以优化实时辅助手术的AI系统。

Method: 提出了双任务自回归模仿学习（DARIL）基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL在动作三元组识别和下一帧预测中表现最佳（34.6%和33.6% mAP），而所有RL方法均表现不佳（最低3.1% mAP）。

Conclusion: 结论表明，在专家标注测试集上，IL优于RL，这对手术AI开发提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Result: 分层溯因逻辑程序的稳定模型语义满足因果充分性、自然必要性和未观察效应无关性等原则。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可作为因果建模框架，有效预测干预效果。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

Result: 在七个基准知识图谱上的实验表明，StableRule在异构环境中表现优异且稳定。

Conclusion: StableRule为实际应用中的知识图谱推理提供了鲁棒且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: GIST通过创新模块和策略，显著提升了跨域点击率预测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Motivation: 在异构团队（如人机协作）中，实时观察、识别和适应队友策略是成功的关键，尤其在时间压力和复杂动态任务中。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习策略的潜在空间，聚类识别策略类型，训练条件合作者，并利用遗憾最小化算法动态适应新队友。

Result: 在定制版Overcooked环境中，TALENTS优于现有基线，尤其在适应陌生人类队友时表现突出。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架有效解决了异构团队中的动态适应问题，为实时协作任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了链式思维（CoT）监控在AI安全防御中的可靠性问题，提出了监控性的重要性，并区分了CoT作为合理化与计算的不同用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对CoT监控的不可靠性问题，特别是在防止严重危害的运行时监控中，强调监控性而非忠实性的重要性。

Method: 引入概念框架区分CoT的两种用途，并通过增加行为难度和压力测试方法验证监控性。

Result: 模型在特定条件下可以隐藏意图，但需要显著帮助；CoT监控仍提供重要防御层。

Conclusion: CoT监控虽非完美，但作为防御手段需持续保护和压力测试。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用机器学习开发急诊科电子分诊工具的框架，并通过优化超参数提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急诊科患者分诊需要优先处理危急和时间敏感的患者，但现有工具如ESI存在局限性，机器学习可提供更高效的分诊方案。

Method: 使用模拟退火（SA）和自适应模拟退火（ASA）优化XGB和CaB的超参数，并与传统网格搜索（GS）对比。

Result: ASA-CaB在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1值上表现最佳，分别为83.3%、83.2%、83.3%、83.2%。

Conclusion: ASA-CaB是一种高效的电子分诊工具优化方法，优于其他算法。

Abstract: Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

Motivation: 说话头生成在数字人类和虚拟元宇宙中至关重要，但现有扩散模型存在推理效率低和多模态信息交互不足的问题。

Method: MoDA通过定义联合参数空间和流匹配简化扩散学习，并引入多模态扩散架构增强表情表达。

Result: 实验表明，MoDA显著提升了视频多样性、真实性和效率。

Conclusion: MoDA适用于实际应用，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a
crucial problem in the realm of digital humans and the virtual metaverse.
Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this
field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However,
several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference
and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial
expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal
information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)
defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural
rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning
process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the
interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately
enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion
strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring
effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency,
making it suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决3D网格局部编辑中需要用户输入（如涂鸦或边界框）的问题，实现自动化和高精度的编辑。

Method: 提出了一种改进的分数蒸馏采样技术，结合预测的定位掩码和参考图像，称为定位调制图像引导。

Result: 在多种网格和图像上验证了方法的有效性，实现了全局一致和局部精确的编辑效果。

Conclusion: 3D PixBrush提供了一种高效、自动化的3D网格局部编辑方法，无需用户干预即可实现高质量结果。

Abstract: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local
regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a
synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image.
Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise.
Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and
automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces
masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method
does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to
achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization
mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to
the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted
localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated
image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a
wide variety of meshes and images.

Result: F-Hash在多种时间变化体积数据集上实现了最先进的训练收敛速度，并优化了渲染性能。

Conclusion: F-Hash为时间变化特征跟踪和演化可视化提供了一种统一的编码解决方案，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its
complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works
transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous
Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression,
rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However,
training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling
large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash,
a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to
greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding
methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design
incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D
multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding
capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to
time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution
for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash
achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying
volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray
marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the
time-varying neural representation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型多关注高层编码器的重建任务，忽视了低层局部特征的有效利用，这些特征通常仅用于激活计算而非直接参与重建。

Method: PointAMaLR采用分层重建策略，低层专注于细粒度特征恢复，高层处理粗粒度特征重建，并嵌入局部注意力模块增强语义特征理解。

Result: 在ModelNet、ShapeNet、ScanObjectNN和S3DIS数据集上，PointAMaLR在分类和重建任务中表现出卓越的准确性和质量。

Conclusion: PointAMaLR不仅验证了多尺度语义理解的有效性，还展示了其在现实场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in
point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on
reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective
utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely
for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel
self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and
processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.
PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local
regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while
upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling
complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature
representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in
the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate
PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset
ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model
achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only
validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but
also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces,
greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by
increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various
industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.
Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high
computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior
visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image
rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices
such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual
behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user
experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,
a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's
gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated
rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering
process.
  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the
computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes
outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To
address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework
called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated
rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering
processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a
state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate
that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while
maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual
avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic
behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character
movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the
overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for
simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly
optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art
neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to
capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural
method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable
dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a
fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual
intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be
integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end
methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,
memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing
for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational
resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为智能电网中的能源盗窃检测提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Conclusion: 该框架为生物空间数据的可控生成提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

Result: 随机森林模型AUC最高（0.8826），SVM次之（0.8747）。NN模型召回率最高（0.7804）。

Conclusion: NIRS结合ML技术是检测肉类真实性的有效方法，有助于打击食品欺诈。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
domains, but their effectiveness in time series forecasting remains
understudied. This work empirically examines whether pre-trained large-scale
time series models (LSTSMs) trained on diverse datasets can outperform
traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific
small-scale architectures. The results highlight scenarios where pretraining
offers advantages and where simpler models remain competitive.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双曲核图融合（HKGF）框架，用于分析多模态神经影像数据，以捕捉脑网络的层次结构，并在神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，无法有效捕捉脑网络的层次结构。HKGF旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HKGF包括多模态图构建模块、双曲核图神经网络（HKGNNs）学习模块、跨模态耦合模块和下游预测的双曲神经网络。

Result: 在超过4,000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在神经认知衰退预测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，可量化与神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

*Aoming Liu,Reuben Tan,Boqing Gong,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSOP是一种数据驱动的方法，通过直接修剪操作而非token，优化Vision Language Model的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有VLM token修剪方法中操作冗余与关键操作丢失的问题。

Method: 将VLM解码器计算分解为三个维度的原子操作，通过贪婪排序确定修剪顺序。

Result: 减少70%计算量，仅损失4%性能，在跨VLM和任务中保持18%性能优势。

Conclusion: GSOP在效率和性能之间取得了显著平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键，但现有方法依赖真实因果结构，不切实际。

Method: 提出CP-DRL框架，利用交互数据近似任务间因果模型差异，结合奖励增益衡量学习能力，形成统一目标。

Result: 在Point Mass基准测试中表现优异，收敛更快、回报更高；在Bipedal Walker-Trivial中方差更低；在Infeasible变体中平均性能最佳。

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of

Result: 在SUPERB上，DiceHuBERT在音素识别和ASR任务中分别提升21%和14%，多任务表现优异。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT在压缩和性能上具有明显优势，适用于多种语音任务。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

<details>

Motivation: 解决具有结构复杂性和多重共线性的多因素问题，如碳排放分析，需要一种既能聚类又能高效选择特征的方法。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督聚类，结合Elastic Net回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业的能源消耗数据（2000-2019），识别出16个类别，并定量评估了排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于分析复杂区域问题（如碳排放），并指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Result: 实验表明，定性验证速度提升9倍，定量验证速度提升218倍，覆盖率分别达到99%和86%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了BNN验证的可扩展性和可信度，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合架构Echo State Transformers (EST)，结合Transformer注意力机制与储层计算，解决了标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在大脑认知任务处理和序列数据处理中存在效率不足和计算复杂度高的问题，需要更高效的模型。

Method: EST结合Transformer注意力机制与储层计算，引入固定大小的分布式记忆系统，动态调整储层参数以实现记忆/非线性平衡。

Result: 在STREAM基准测试中，EST在12个任务中的8个上优于GRUs、LSTMs和标准Transformer。

Conclusion: EST是GRUs和LSTMs的有效替代方案，在资源受限和低数据场景中补充标准Transformer。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Result: 在针对BCL-2的案例中，框架成功生成多样化分子并优化其性质，提升分子质量（如QED>0.6的分子数量增加）。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选和优化，并具有灵活集成新工具的潜力。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Method: 使用ChatGPT模拟化学家推理，生成知识表示，并通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子结构特征融合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy提供了一种灵活且可推广的药物发现方法，支持真实化学家输入的集成，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial

leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Conclusion: SDKD框架能有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Result: 多注意力头在特定条件下能协同增强信息传播，提升混合时间和极小极大保真度。

Conclusion: 多注意力头机制在理论分析和实验中均显示出优于单头的性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

TL;DR: InvisibleInk是一个基于LLM的长文本生成框架，通过差分隐私保护敏感信息，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在LLM生成文本中安全整合私有信息的开放性问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有令牌的小超集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 计算成本降低8倍，生成的长文本质量与非私有生成相当。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能以低于非私有生成10倍的计算成本生成私有长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个框架（Answered with Evidence），用于评估LLM生成的答案是否基于科学文献支持，并通过比较不同检索增强系统（包括PubMed和新型证据源）的表现，发现结合多种证据源可显著提高答案的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在生物医学问答中的广泛应用，其答案的准确性和证据支持性引发担忧，因此需要一种评估框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用比较管道分析数千个医生提交的问题，包括基于PubMed的检索增强系统和新型证据源（Alexandria）。

Result: PubMed系统为约44%的问题提供证据支持的答案，新型证据源为50%，结合后可靠答案覆盖率达70%以上。

Conclusion: 随着LLM总结科学内容能力的提升，需要能够准确检索或实时生成证据的系统以最大化其价值。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对黎曼流形上数据训练的神经网络的新泛化边界，通过引入流形特定属性（如曲率、体积增长等）改进了现有基于欧几里得几何的泛化理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泛化理论依赖欧几里得几何的复杂性度量，无法反映非欧空间的固有结构，因此需要引入流形几何特性以改进泛化分析。

Method: 通过引入覆盖数边界，显式结合流形的截面曲率、体积增长和注入半径等几何特性，推导出更尖锐的Rademacher复杂性边界。

Result: 在曲率非零的低维流形中，泛化边界显著优于欧几里得结果，尤其在负曲率和正曲率空间中分别展示了复杂性的增加和正则化效应。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解内在几何如何影响学习能力提供了理论依据，对结构化数据领域的深度学习具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Result: 新方法在均方误差和平均绝对误差上优于传统方法，且能揭示组织间的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了数据补全的准确性，还为跨物种药物研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive
chatbots and robotic control.

Motivation: 探讨通用逼近系统的数学极限，揭示其灾难性失败与表达能力之间的必然联系。

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和经验必要性三个层次论证，证明灾难性失败点的密度与表达能力成正比。

Result: 完美对齐是数学上不可能的，需在不可控性存在的情况下寻求安全操作。

Conclusion: 研究结果重新定义了UAT安全性问题，从追求完美控制转向如何在不可控性下安全操作。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

Result: 框架提供了数据效用与控制之间的权衡，为开发者、研究者和监管者提供指导。

Conclusion: 需重新思考现代AI技术中的数据保护，以促进可信赖的数据实践。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据在现实应用中普遍存在，但现有的二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性，需要复杂的参数调优。

Method: ACRSLF采用自调谐立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，动态稳定非凸优化并精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在两个工业数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF收敛更快且表示精度更高。

Conclusion: ACRSLF在建模高维不完整数据时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

Method: Optimas为每个组件维护一个局部奖励函数（LRF），满足局部-全局对齐性质，通过迭代优化LRF实现独立配置更新。

Result: 在五个实际复合系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas提供了一种通用且有效的方法，显著提升复合系统的性能。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

*Thomas A. Henzinger,Mahyar Karimi,Konstantin Kueffner,Kaushik Mallik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时验证算法公平性的通用框架，适用于模型未知但具有马尔可夫链结构的系统，支持多种公平性属性的监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统在人类决策中广泛应用，确保其公平性（不基于敏感属性偏袒个体）至关重要。

Method: 引入一种规范语言建模常见公平性属性（如人口统计平等、机会均等），构建监测器实时评估系统公平性，提供统计保证的误差界限。

Result: 监测算法分为均匀误差界限和非均匀误差界限两类，实验显示监测器能在毫秒级更新评估结果。

Conclusion: 该框架有效验证系统公平性，适用于实际场景（如银行贷款、大学招生），具有高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

*Egor Maximov,Yulia Kuzkina,Azamat Kanametov,Alexander Prutko,Aleksei Goncharov,Maxim Zhelnin,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏性在大型语言模型压缩中的优势，相比2:4稀疏性更灵活且存储开销小，同时通过结构化稀疏模式处理异常权重，结合简单技术提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型规模的增大，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。然而，结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏化）因灵活性不足和对异常权重的敏感性而表现不佳。

Method: 研究采用8:16半结构化稀疏性，并应用结构化稀疏模式处理显著权重，结合方差校正和类似SmoothQuant的权重均衡技术。

Result: 8:16稀疏性在性能阈值上超越未压缩或较小模型，且相比2:4稀疏性更灵活，存储开销更小（0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element）。结构化稀疏方法在异常权重处理上与无结构化方法竞争，甚至表现更好。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏性是一种高效的压缩方法，结合简单技术可进一步提升稀疏模型的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

TL;DR: 研究比较了多模态元学习模型和视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在手写图表自动评分中的表现，发现元学习模型在二元分类任务中更优，而VLLMs在更复杂的三元分类任务中略胜一筹。


<details>

Motivation: 在线学习需求增加，但手写图表自动评分研究较少，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 采用多模态元学习模型和VLLMs，并在真实数据集上比较其表现。

Result: 元学习模型在二元分类任务中优于VLLMs，而VLLMs在复杂任务中表现稍好。

Conclusion: VLLMs虽具潜力，但可靠性和实用性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

TL;DR: BERT4Traj是一种基于Transformer的模型，用于从稀疏移动数据中重建完整的人类移动轨迹，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动数据通常因采集方法限制而稀疏，影响公共健康、交通和城市规划等应用。

Method: BERT4Traj结合空间嵌入、时间嵌入和上下文背景特征（如人口统计和锚点），采用类似BERT的掩码建模和自注意力机制。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的CDR和GPS数据集上，BERT4Traj显著优于马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM等传统模型。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细连续的移动轨迹，提升对人类移动模式的理解。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Helmholtz Machine（C²HM），通过目标导向的非对称推理和循环一致性，增强了生成模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Helmholtz Machine的对称数据驱动更新限制了其目标导向推理和时序扩展模拟的能力。

Method: C²HM将推理重构为目标导向的非对称过程，通过前向生成和逆向细化的循环一致性实现潜在轨迹的模拟。

Result: C²HM提高了表示效率，支持路径依赖推理和空间组合想象。

Conclusion: C²HM为生成建模提供了一种生物启发的替代方案，统一了记忆规划和无监督学习。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习中目标泛化错误的风险，即代理目标在训练环境中表现类似但部署时偏离设计目标。

Method: 理论分析MEV和MMER目标下的泛化错误可能性，并在程序生成的网格世界环境中进行实证验证。

Result: MEV方法存在目标泛化错误，而MMER方法更鲁棒，但并非总能找到MMER策略。

Conclusion: 最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）是缓解目标泛化错误的有前景方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

TL;DR: NeuralDMD结合神经隐式表示与动态模式分解（DMD），从稀疏、噪声测量中重建连续时空动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面临从未见过的动态，且测量间接、噪声多、稀疏。需要一种模型无关的方法来重建复杂动态。

Method: 结合神经网络的表达能力与DMD的线性动态模式，实现低维表示与预测。

Result: 在风速场重建和等离子体演化恢复任务中，NeuralDMD优于现有基线。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是跨领域动态系统成像的通用工具。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法多专注于显式或隐式关系，缺乏同时支持两者的现代框架，且未充分利用重复结构模式。

Method: 结合多岛遗传编程和生物序列分析启发的模式库，通过反馈驱动进化引擎和隐式导数指标支持显式和隐式关系发现。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，恢复率领先，速度提升显著，并开源了框架。

Conclusion: 结构感知进化搜索在科学发现中具有强大潜力，SymMatika为可解释建模和符号发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模ML模型的能耗主要由数据移动主导，现有稀疏化方法存在精度损失或性能开销问题。

Method: BLaST通过迭代稀疏化权重矩阵为适合SpMM乘法的块稀疏模式，并优化稀疏MLP内核。

Result: BLaST实现95%稀疏度且精度损失可忽略，性能提升最高达16.7倍，内存使用减少3.12倍。

Conclusion: BLaST通过降低能耗、内存占用和延迟，推动下一代大规模AI系统发展。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Result: LLMs表现出显著的选择支持性偏差和对不一致建议的过度敏感，偏离了贝叶斯更新规范。这两种机制解释了其固执和对批评的过度敏感。

Conclusion: 研究提供了LLM自信的机制性解释，揭示了其固执和过度敏感的内在原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Result: 在WILDS基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了其在鲁棒领域泛化中的潜力。

Conclusion: 集合值预测为领域泛化提供了一种有前景的方向，能够兼顾鲁棒性和预测集的小型化。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理中GPU内存受限和KV缓存占用问题，同时充分利用CPU计算资源。

Method: 结合GPU上的密集注意力和CPU上的并行稀疏注意力，使用log-sum-exp融合输出，并引入细粒度稀疏化策略。

Result: HGCA在性能和准确性上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，支持更长序列和更大批量。

Conclusion: HGCA无需重新训练模型即可集成到现有框架中，显著提升LLM推理的扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中潜力巨大，但现有方法主要局限于图像和文本对。PiCME旨在系统评估多种临床数据类型的整合效果。

Method: 提出PiCME框架，预训练对比模型评估26种模态组合，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM动态加权各模态重要性。

Result: 对比模型在三模态设置中表现优异，五模态时性能下降，但Modality-Gated LSTM显著提升性能（AUROC从73.19%到76.93%）。

Conclusion: PiCME首次在MIMIC数据上实现全模态对比学习，为模态选择、训练策略和公平性提供了指导。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

Motivation: 解决AI视觉与人类视觉在形状识别、鲁棒性和对抗攻击方面的显著差异。

Method: 通过模拟人类视觉从婴儿到成年的发展过程，设计了一种新的视觉训练方法（DVD）。

Result: 该方法使AI在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优于现有大规模模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化学习方式而非增加数据量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Conclusion: LaTF通过联合优化表示学习和生成建模，有效捕捉系统的慢自由度并准确生成平衡分布，为复杂分子系统的热力学分析提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）零阶微调中的内存和计算瓶颈，特别是单设备执行和低吞吐量问题。

Method: 提出DistZO2框架，结合三种并行策略（PertP、DDP和2D并行）及硬件感知通信优化。

Result: 在OPT-175B上，DistZO2比ZO2快3倍，同时保持内存效率。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调至多GPU系统，显著提升性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路由模型在深度学习中的表现可以通过神经抑制进一步优化，抑制共享信号以选择更专业的路径。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制神经群体中的共享信号，使路由模型为每个数据样本选择专家路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升通用任务的性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型中未被充分研究的方法，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于置信预测集的顺序查询策略（C-IP），用于优化LLM在问答任务中的查询效率，相比传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的信息增益方法（IP）在LLM中难以准确估计不确定性，导致查询选择和预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出C-IP方法，利用置信预测集与条件熵的关系，通过平均预测集大小估计不确定性。

Result: 实验显示C-IP在20 Questions和MediQ数据集上表现优于传统IP和基于不确定性的链式思维方法。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布无关且鲁棒的策略，能提高预测性能并减少查询次数，同时增强可解释性。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Motivation: 探索动态大气变量的低秩特性，并填补Sentinel-5P数据中的缺失值，以提升数据完整性。

Method: 采用基于CP分解和交替最小二乘法的低秩张量模型（LRTM）进行数据填补，并与地统计学方法对比。

Result: LRTM成功重建缺失值，尤其在云层遮挡情况下表现优异，并能预测异常值和热点区域。

Conclusion: 低秩张量模型在填补动态大气变量缺失值方面具有显著优势，适用于大范围时空数据分析。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的域适应方法依赖小批量训练，导致全局分布建模不足，对齐不稳定。

Method: 提出GVI-DA框架，通过变分推断学习连续、类条件全局先验，结合潜在特征重建和全局码本学习。

Result: 在四个基准和三十八个任务中表现最优，并分析了先验连续性、码本大小和伪标签噪声的影响。

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论和实践上均优于现有方法，尤其在全局建模和鲁棒性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度自适应参数分配方法（MGAA），用于优化大语言模型的低秩近似压缩，避免统一压缩比例，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵采用统一压缩比例，忽视了其对模型性能的差异化影响，且现有启发式搜索策略计算效率低、泛化能力差。

Method: MGAA方法通过两层策略自适应分配参数：1）子层间基于输入输出余弦相似度分配压缩比例；2）子层内基于能量分布特性分配压缩比例。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和多模态模型LLaVA上的实验表明，MGAA显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: MGAA是一种高效且通用的压缩方法，适用于大语言模型和多模态模型。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心世界模型在视觉复杂度有限的环境中表现良好，但在复杂纹理和杂乱场景中的泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入Dyn-O，通过将对象中心特征解耦为动态无关和动态感知组件，改进表示学习和动态建模。

Result: 在Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O直接从像素观测中学习对象中心世界模型，预测精度优于DreamerV3。

Conclusion: Dyn-O在复杂环境中表现出色，通过特征解耦实现了更精细的特征操控和多样化的轨迹生成。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing
Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP
scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple
problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art
results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，ReTimeCausal在挑战性条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal有效解决了不规则采样和缺失数据问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Motivation: JAX缺乏对混合精度训练的稳健支持，而混合精度训练是提升神经网络训练效率的重要工具。

Method: MPX通过将输入和输出转换为半精度，并引入动态损失缩放机制，解决梯度下溢和溢出问题。它还与JAX的类型提升行为兼容，支持选择性全精度操作。

Result: MPX无缝集成到Equinox和Flax等流行工具箱中，用户只需少量修改即可将全精度流程转换为混合精度版本。

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating

Conclusion: 该方法不仅优化了线性注意力的性能，还揭示了注意力机制在不同层的复杂性演变。

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential
decision tasks. However, recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of RL
policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Result: 综述涵盖了分类、聚类、回归和排序的绝对评估指标，填补了现有指导的空白。

Conclusion: 该综述为从业者提供了选择合适评估指标的工具，提升了模型评估和跨模型比较的有效性。

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Result: 证明了$z$-变换方法在推导新渐近结果中的有效性，特别是通过谱维度刻画收敛行为。

Conclusion: $z$-变换方法在分析优化算法的渐近行为中具有广泛适用性和强大功能。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and
related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle
to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular
representation learning.

Conclusion: 结合形状信息的混合方法能生成更稳健的分子表示，为分子机器学习开辟新途径。

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

Abstract: ObjectRL is an open-source Python codebase for deep reinforcement learning
(RL), designed for research-oriented prototyping with minimal programming
effort. Unlike existing codebases, ObjectRL is built on Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the
implementation, modification, and evaluation of new algorithms. ObjectRL lowers
the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use
cases that highlight its flexibility and suitability for rapid prototyping. The

Result: 实验证明MAFG能有效自动化特征生成，显著提升下游科学数据挖掘任务性能。

Conclusion: MAFG为科学数据特征生成提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Result: RLRS方法在复杂模型（如MoE）中训练速度提升高达23%，且可扩展到27倍大的模型。

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单有效的方法，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，适用于大规模神经网络优化。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Conclusion: 该框架为生成真实的关系型表格数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

Result: 通信成本从d维降至k维，噪声影响降低为σ²k。

Conclusion: DOME框架在保证差分隐私的同时，显著优化了通信和噪声问题。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Conclusion: SGTK和SGNK有效简化计算，保持表达能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Conclusion: KLDM为晶体材料生成提供了一种有效的方法，解决了对称性和分数坐标处理的挑战。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Method: 采用因子化蒙特卡洛Dropout框架，将总预测方差分解为共享编码器中的表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和结果头中的预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。

Result: 在三种合成协变量偏移情况下，区间校准良好（ECE < 0.03），且满足sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2。在真实世界双胞胎队列中，表示不确定性在分布外样本中显著增加。

Conclusion: 模块级分解为深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源检测和解释提供了实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Conclusion: PEM-UDE为多尺度脑模型提供新途径，连接微观神经元动态与宏观脑活动。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Motivation: 临床数据与组学数据之间存在不一致性，识别异常样本有助于重塑疾病理解，尤其是发现早期信号。

Method: MLASDO通过三步流程实现：1）使用支持向量机分类健康与病例；2）检测组内异常样本；3）结合临床数据和专家知识解释异常。

Result: 在帕金森病队列中，MLASDO检测到15例健康对照组异常样本（具有PD特征）和22例PD病例异常样本（具有健康特征）。

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source
R package available at: https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/MLASDO.

Motivation: 科学应用需要实时替代模型来捕捉多物理场强耦合系统的行为，但现有神经网络操作符在多物理场问题中的表现尚不明确。

Method: 通过评估DeepONet及其变体在单物理场、弱耦合和强耦合多物理场系统中的表现，比较单分支和多分支架构的性能。

Result: 单分支网络在强耦合系统中表现更优，而多分支架构适用于解耦或单物理场问题。替代模型的预测速度比高保真有限元求解器快1.8e4倍。

Conclusion: 架构设计与物理耦合强度的对齐对神经网络操作符的性能至关重要，为多物理场系统的实时建模提供了指导。

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Result: 发现微调不安全代码会引发内部变化，削弱对齐性，并识别出一个共享的潜在维度，该维度控制对齐行为，且易被不安全代码激活。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM对齐性的脆弱性，强调需要开发更鲁棒的微调策略以保持跨领域的安全性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期科技初创企业依赖外部资金，但天使投资决策主观且资源密集。CFA工具虽准确但耗时，限制了其广泛应用。研究旨在通过AI模型解决这一限制。

Method: 使用多个LLMs从600份初创企业融资演讲中提取CFA因素，并训练机器学习分类模型，以预测投资决策。

Result: 最佳模型预测准确率达85.0%，与传统人工评估显著相关（Spearman's r = 0.896）。

Conclusion: AI与CFA框架结合提供了可扩展、可靠且减少偏见的初创企业评估方法，解决了CFA的采用限制。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过重新训练图扩散模型来减少偏差，但效率较低。FAROS直接在生成过程中优化公平性。

Method: FAROS通过计算最优切换节点比例和选择扩散步骤，结合多标准约束，确保生成的图在保持准确性的同时实现公平性。

Result: 实验表明，FAROS在减少公平性差异的同时，保持了与基线相当的准确性，并在某些情况下实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: FAROS通过多标准约束，在准确性和公平性之间取得了更好的平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评分器（LLM-as-a-judge）虽然可扩展，但存在可靠性不一致和系统性偏差的问题，需要一种方法同时评估评分器并解决研究问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯GLM建模评分结果，量化评分差异和偏差，并提供不确定性估计。

Result: 该方法能够增强传统可靠性指标（如评分者间一致性），并明确分歧来源。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了更稳健和可解释的自动评分器使用方法，支持性能分析和偏差检测。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为VLSI设计流程提供了一种高效且准确的有效电容建模方法，显著提升了时序分析的效率。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

Motivation: LLMs在资源受限环境中部署困难，传统低秩权重压缩假设不适用于LLMs，而激活的低秩结构更显著。

Method: 提出IMPACT框架，结合激活结构和梯度敏感性，通过重要性加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量优化低秩近似。

Result: 实验显示IMPACT在模型大小减少48.6%的同时，准确性优于或接近现有方法。

Conclusion: IMPACT为LLM压缩提供了一种更有效的方法，显著提升了压缩效率与性能保持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: MatRL生成的算法在数值实验中优于文献中的多种基线方法，且能推广到相同分布的大矩阵。

Conclusion: MatRL为矩阵函数计算提供了一种自动化、高效的算法设计方法，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大规模电子结构预测中的计算资源限制，展示了高性能扩展能力。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

Motivation: 解决高维回归中ICD-10代码作为预测变量时，OLS模型系数不稳定的问题。

Method: 将ICD-10代码从七字符截断为六或更少字符，降低维度并保留诊断类别。

Result: 截断代码减少了系数估计的方差，提高了模型的稳定性和一致性。

Conclusion: 降低ICD-10代码粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，解释了为何实际应用中更倾向于使用DRGs和HCC等更宽泛的分组。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Method: OrbitAll结合了自旋极化轨道特征和图神经网络，满足SE(3)-等变性，能够处理任意分子系统。

Result: OrbitAll在预测带电、开壳和溶剂化分子方面表现优异，且能泛化到比训练数据大得多的分子，同时仅需十分之一的训练数据即可达到化学精度。

Conclusion: OrbitAll通过物理信息架构显著提升了分子系统的表示能力，为复杂化学问题的计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

### [575] [Latent FxLMS: Accelerating Active Noise Control with Neural Adaptive Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03854)
*Kanad Sarkar,Austin Lu,Manan Mittal,Yongjie Zhuang,Ryan Corey,Andrew Singer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于低维流形的Latent FxLMS方法，通过训练自编码器约束自适应滤波器权重，提升收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FxLMS在主动噪声控制中需要优化高维滤波器权重，而利用噪声源空间区域的先验知识，可以将其约束到低维流形上以提高效率。

Method: 训练自编码器学习稳态自适应滤波器的权重，通过解码器生成滤波器权重，并在潜在空间进行更新。

Result: 在特定条件下，Latent FxLMS比标准FxLMS收敛更快，且稳态误差相当。

Conclusion: Latent FxLMS通过低维流形约束，有效提升了收敛速度，为主动噪声控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

*Zekai Wang,Bing Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TK-GCN是一个两阶段框架，结合了几何感知空间编码和长程时间建模，用于不规则几何域上的时空动态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动态联合建模的挑战。

Method: 第一阶段使用Koopman增强的图卷积网络（K-GCN）将高维动态嵌入近似线性的潜在空间；第二阶段使用Transformer模块建模潜在空间中的时间进展。

Result: 在心脏时空动态预测中，TK-GCN表现优于现有基线，预测准确性高。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态，适用于长程预测。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Result: 高阶PINNs在挑战性ODE基准测试中表现出更高的精度，适用于控制不确定物理系统。

Conclusion: 高阶PINNs模型有效提升了ODE参数不确定性问题的解决能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Motivation: 传统PDE数值求解器计算量大，而ML代理模型在自回归推理中误差累积严重，限制了长期准确性。

Method: 采用深度集成框架，训练多个随机初始化的ML模型，并在推理时聚合预测，以利用模型多样性减少误差传播。

Result: 在三个PDE驱动的动态系统上验证，显著减少了误差累积，推理时间远快于数值求解器。

Conclusion: 集成方法在多样物理系统中表现出鲁棒性，是传统求解器的高效准确替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic
perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation
ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test
distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative
expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and

depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和LLM的扩展状态空间方法，为健康行为干预提供了高效的数据利用和性能提升。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Conclusion: 神经网络泛化能力源于局部极值动态映射，极值增量算法为解决传统问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

Conclusion: GPI是一个高效、通用的框架，适用于非结构化数据的因果和预测推断，且无需微调生成模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both
causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and
images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An

Result: 模型在预测转换者（病情加重的患者）方面表现优异，且对缺失访问和特征具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型在早期诊断和改善患者预后方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Result: 通过广泛实验验证，该方法在多种领域的在线和离线环境中均优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为风险敏感强化学习提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

Conclusion: 解耦方法优于现有耦合方法，尤其在复杂结构化领域的优化任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了多模态数据融合的质量，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

Result: 在QM9数据集上，GNN模型对某些属性表现出良好的学习性能，并能推断含20个非氢原子的小化学图。

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN框架通过结合GNN，提升了分子推断的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba能够高效地同时建模多变量交通数据，为实际交通拥堵预测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model

features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何通过针对性继续预训练提升基于合成数据预训练的表格数据基础模型性能。

Method: 利用少量精选的大规模真实数据集进行继续预训练，而非使用更广泛但可能噪声较多的数据源。

Result: Real-TabPFN在OpenML AutoML Benchmark的29个数据集上实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 针对性继续预训练是提升表格数据基础模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance
on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this
performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training
phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection
of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior
downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier
corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN,
achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML
Benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、可边缘部署的管道，用于检测化学和生物实验室中的传感器异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室传感器异常检测需要快速适应新液体或传感器的能力，同时保持轻量化和高效。

Method: 使用定制PCB捕获传感器数据，通过基于注意力的单类自动编码器进行训练，仅需30分钟正常数据即可达到可用状态。

Result: 模型在合成微异常测试中F1得分为0.72，精度为0.89，召回率为0.61；最终模型转换为31 kB的TensorFlow-Lite二进制文件，在边缘设备上运行，延迟低于2秒。

Conclusion: 该管道可在1小时内完成从收集到部署的整个工作流程，展示了快速适应新环境的能力。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a
new liquid or sensor is introduced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于树的位置嵌入方法，显式编码AST的层次关系，提升了Transformer模型在源代码表示任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置嵌入方法无法充分捕捉源代码的层次结构（如AST），限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出树形位置嵌入方法，结合节点深度和兄弟索引，集成到CodeBERTa模型中。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa在MLM预训练和克隆检测任务中均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 显式编码源代码结构信息对提升Transformer模型的表示能力至关重要。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市社会经济建模多依赖局部人口特征，忽略了网络效应，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用人口普查的通勤记录构建城市移动网络，结合图神经网络和传统神经网络进行建模。

Result: 在12个美国主要城市的实验中，该方法优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 为城市研究提供了考虑网络效应的方法，对政策制定和规划具有启示意义。

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in
stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the
benchmark by implementing and comparing three recently proposed, but as-of-yet
unimplemented, algorithms both in terms of optimization performance, and
fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package

Conclusion: 研究提供了实时监测和SAT长期规划的实用方程，强调了表土温度的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential
for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature
directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops
and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge
layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent
temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal
temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the
thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical
equations for real-time monitoring and long-term planning of SAT operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于影响函数（IF）的数据评估方法，用于解决Sharpness-aware Minimization（SAM）中的数据影响评估问题，分别基于Hessian和梯度轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在训练中通过损失景观几何提升泛化能力，但面临噪声数据和隐私问题。数据归因（data attribution）是潜在解决方案，但传统IF方法不适用于SAM的双层计算结构。

Method: 基于IF，开发了两种方法：Hessian-based IF和Gradient Trajectory-based IF。前者通过闭式估计数据影响，后者利用梯度轨迹信息提高准确性。

Result: 实验证明两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了SAM中数据影响评估的挑战，为噪声数据处理和模型优化提供了新工具。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dreamer算法的潜在空间压缩可能导致关键信息丢失，影响智能体性能。现有方法（如Δ-IRIS和DIAMOND）虽解决了这一问题，但直接从像素训练降低了效率。

Method: EMERALD结合空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测，生成潜在空间中的准确轨迹，避免直接从像素训练。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD实现了最先进的性能，成为首个在10M环境步数内超越人类专家表现的方法，并解锁了所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD提供了一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体性能，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Conclusion: 注意力机制的关系归纳偏置可通过等变性分析分类，为理解其泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了数据无知识蒸馏（DFKD）中非可迁移学习（NTL）教师的问题，提出了一种对抗陷阱逃逸（ATEsc）方法，通过识别和过滤OOD样本来提升DFKD效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但未探讨来自不可信教师的鲁棒性和安全性问题。本文首次研究了NTL教师对DFKD的影响。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，通过将合成样本分为脆弱组（ID-like）和鲁棒组（OOD-like），分别用于正常知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD对NTL教师的性能。

Conclusion: ATEsc方法解决了NTL教师对DFKD的干扰问题，为不可信教师场景下的知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNNs和Transformers在编码相对位置信息上的差异，探索在位置不重要的领域中GNNs替代Transformers的可行性。

Method: 通过理论分析和合成实验验证GNNs与Transformers在无相对位置信息时的等效性，并在单细胞转录组学数据集上进行实验。

Result: GNNs在单细胞转录组学中表现与Transformers相当，但计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: 在位置信息不关键的应用中，GNNs可以作为Transformers的高效替代方案，挑战了Transformers始终最优的传统观点。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Motivation: 通过为TM预测引入概率评分和不确定性量化技术，进一步提高模型的透明度和解释性。

Method: 分析TM学习动态，推导出概率评分，并通过模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集验证方法的有效性。

Result: 概率评分与数据底层概率相关，且TM在训练数据域外预测时表现出较低的置信度。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化技术为TM模型提供了新见解，并可能改进现有图像分类模型。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

Abstract: Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through

general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a
unified, scalable platform for differentiable meshfree simulation and
data-driven geomechanical inference.

Result: Extra Trees算法准确率77%，冬季污染是夏季两倍，2014至2022年改善31%。

Conclusion: 智能预测系统可为城市规划提供工具，改善空气质量管理。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research

### [607] [An explicit formulation of the learned noise predictor $ε_θ({\bf x}_t, t)$ via the forward-process noise $ε_{t}$ in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04203)

Result: 揭示了前向过程噪声对学习预测器的贡献，并澄清了基本等式的来源。

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型的理论分析提供了新视角，有助于算法设计和进一步研究。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法（PMC），通过部分模型崩溃避免直接优化敏感数据，更有效地移除隐私信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法直接优化敏感数据，可能强化其暴露，违背最小化使用原则。

Method: 利用生成模型自身生成导致分布崩溃的特性，部分触发崩溃以实现遗忘。

Result: 理论证明PMC能收敛到遗忘目标，实验显示其优于现有方法，更有效移除隐私信息。

Conclusion: PMC为符合实际隐私约束的全面遗忘提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

TL;DR: CP-Composer是一个生成框架，通过几何约束实现零样本环肽生成，成功率达到38%-84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环肽因其独特的几何约束具有更好的生化特性，但设计靶向环肽因数据不足而受限。

Method: CP-Composer将环化模式分解为单元约束，通过扩散模型结合几何条件生成环肽。

Result: 模型能生成多样化的靶向环肽，不同环化策略下成功率为38%-84%。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了高效工具，填补了数据不足的空白。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩恢复在压缩感知理论中具有重要应用，但现有方法主要针对矩阵数据。本文旨在扩展NIHT方法至高阶张量，以利用多路数据的低维结构实现高效恢复。

Method: 提出TNIHT方法，支持CP和Tucker两种张量分解模型，并在张量受限等距性质（TRIP）下建立收敛定理。

Result: 理论证明了TNIHT的收敛性，实验表明其在合成数据、图像和视频数据上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TNIHT是一种高效的低秩张量恢复方法，适用于多种数据场景，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Carles Gelada,Jacob Buckman,Sean Zhang,Txus Bach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中成本过高或过低，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型因安全对齐导致的过度拒绝问题，提升用户体验和模型实用性。

Method: 利用多样化查询的内部激活模式，通过微调单一模型层精确调整拒绝机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力和整体实用性。

Conclusion: ACTOR是一种高效且鲁棒的训练框架，能显著减少过度拒绝而不损害安全性。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Conclusion: Retformer为AD早期诊断提供了高效且可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体系统的高维、非线性和多尺度动态特性需要实时、三维、多组分测量，但实际应用中传感器有限，仅能提供部分测量。

Result: 在模拟环境中成功减少简化道路车辆的空气阻力，并确定最优历史长度和控制策略架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为传感器有限的实际应用提供了可行的控制策略优化方案。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据分布和模型架构的异质性挑战，特别是原型分离不足的问题。

Method: 结合原型对齐（PA）和原型放大（PU），前者优化全局原型配置以最大化角度分离，后者增强欧几里得空间中的分离。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，原型分离效果更好。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm继承了PBFL的通信效率，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限环境中通信效率低的问题，尤其是原型共享方法在大特征维度和多类别时的效率下降。

Method: 采用类原型稀疏化（CPS）和自适应原型缩放，前者通过结构化稀疏减少传输数据量，后者根据类别分布调整原型。

Result: 实验显示TinyProto通信成本降低4倍，且无需客户端额外计算开销，支持异构架构。

Conclusion: TinyProto在资源受限的异构联邦学习中表现出色，兼具高效通信和性能保持。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于交互分析的特征选择或模型开发提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型（如SatMAE、DoFA）的自监督学习任务忽视了农业景观的独特时间特性（如自然周期），因此需要针对农业场景设计新的预训练任务。

Method: 提出三种农业特定的预训练任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF），并在SICKLE和FTW India数据集上进行评估。

Result: FF在作物分类上达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE，TD在多数任务中表现优异；FF在印度全国范围验证中达到54.2% IoU。

Conclusion: 农业特定的预训练任务显著提升了遥感基础模型在农业场景中的性能，未来可进一步扩展应用范围。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Result: 在Microsoft Big2015和BODMAS数据集上，D3QN分别达到99.22%和98.83%的准确率，同时平均仅使用61和56个特征，计算效率提升30.1倍和42.5倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的自适应特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中表现出色，显著提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Result: 在树结构和随机图变体中表现显著优于现有方法，实验验证了训练成本的高效性。

Conclusion: 通过因果建模和针对性干预，提出的框架在层次强化学习中实现了更高的效率。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

TL;DR: APCs是一种新型概率电路框架，通过联合建模数据和嵌入，实现高效的概率推理和表示学习，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率电路（PCs）在表示学习领域尚未充分探索，现有方法依赖外部神经嵌入或基于激活的编码，存在局限性。

Method: 提出自动编码概率电路（APCs），扩展PCs以联合建模数据和嵌入，通过可微采样实现端到端训练。

Result: APCs在重建质量、嵌入生成和缺失数据处理方面优于现有PC方法，且与神经自动编码器竞争。

Conclusion: APCs展示了PCs在表示学习中的潜力，为鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏提供了新方向。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: 该专著通过三章内容探讨了逆向强化学习（IRL），分别从微观经济学中的显示偏好理论、贝叶斯IRL和自适应IRL方法展开研究。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是通过IRL方法从观察到的行为中推断代理的效用函数，并解决噪声环境下的行为建模问题。

Method: 第一章使用显示偏好理论（Afriat定理）重建效用函数；第二章研究贝叶斯IRL，探讨理性不关注代理的行为；第三章提出基于Langevin动力学的自适应IRL方法。

Result: 成功重建了代理的效用函数，识别了认知雷达和贝叶斯最优序列检测器，并开发了实时跟踪时变效用函数的算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为IRL提供了多角度的理论框架和实用算法，适用于噪声和动态环境中的行为分析。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Motivation: 在强化学习中，传统方法通常假设最优策略存在于给定的策略类中，而本文旨在放宽这一假设，研究如何在更一般的条件下学习竞争性策略。

Method: 提出了一种通用的策略学习框架，基于非欧几里得空间的一阶优化方法，具体包括三种算法：Steepest Descent Policy Optimization、改进的Conservative Policy Iteration和Policy Mirror Descent。

Result: 在满足变分梯度支配（VGD）条件的凸策略类下，获得了样本复杂度的上界，并通过实验验证了VGD条件的实用性。

Conclusion: 论文表明，在较弱的假设下，仍能设计出有效的策略学习算法，并通过实验支持了理论结果。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Result: 在腾讯应用商店和公开数据集上表现优异，下游信用风险管理任务性能提升10.70%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分层多标签分类问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Result: 新框架将攻击成功率提升48%，效率提高两个数量级，并发现大多数优化策略对输出危害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估协议对准确评估和增强语言模型安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Result: 理论和实验表明，弹性权重耦合、特征学习强度、数据集大小以及任务对齐对迁移学习效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 该理论为迁移学习提供了新的视角，揭示了特征学习机制下任务间特征共享的复杂动态。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出ESSA框架，利用进化策略（ES）高效对齐大语言模型（LLMs），解决了传统强化学习（RLHF）的高计算成本和训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法在LLM对齐中存在高计算成本、内存需求和训练不稳定性问题，尤其在大型模型中更为明显。

Method: 采用进化策略（ES）进行对齐，结合低秩适应降低优化维度，无需梯度计算，具有高并行性和内存效率。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ESSA比梯度方法（如GRPO）收敛更快且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: ESSA为LLM对齐提供了一种高效、可扩展的替代方案，适用于大型模型的后训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Method: 提出LoSiA，通过梯度稀疏分析动态定位并优化关键子网络参数，减少额外矩阵乘法；LoSiA-Pro进一步优化实现更快训练。

Result: LoSiA在领域专业化和常识推理任务中性能接近全微调，训练时间最短；LoSiA-Pro降低训练延迟27%。

Conclusion: LoSiA在减少计算开销的同时保持高性能，并缓解持续训练中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学实际应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性驱动的决策过程，在医疗等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Conclusion: DOTResize通过重新投影神经元宽度，有效压缩模型且保留有用信号，是一种高效的压缩方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

diverse tasks, but their ability to forecast future events remains
understudied. A year ago, large language models struggle to come close to the
accuracy of a human crowd. I evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on 464 forecasting
questions from Metaculus, comparing their performance against human
superforecasters. Frontier models achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass
the human crowd but still significantly underperform a group of
superforecasters.

Motivation: 现代无线通信网络对频谱利用效率的需求日益增长，而AMC在动态频谱分配和干扰抑制中至关重要。边缘设备资源有限，需要轻量级AMC模型。

Method: 设计了双路径深度残差收缩网络（DP-DRSN）和紧凑的CNN-LSTM混合架构，仅含27,000训练参数。

Conclusion: 该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高效且准确的AMC，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and
RML2018.01a datasets, respectively demonstrating a strong balance between model
efficiency and classification performance. These results underscore the model's
potential for enabling accurate and efficient AMC on-edge devices with limited
resources.

TL;DR: Photon Splatting是一种基于物理的神经代理模型，用于复杂环境中实时无线信道预测，通过虚拟光子源和几何感知实现高效预测。


<details>

Motivation: 解决复杂环境中无线信道预测的实时性和准确性需求，支持新配置的泛化能力。

Result: 实验显示30毫秒级推理延迟，准确预测多种配置下的信道响应。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时适应性和可解释性，适用于6G网络规划和无线数字孪生平台。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Result: 在稀疏奖励的困难探索环境中，该方法实现了最先进的样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过合理利用专家演示和模拟器重置功能，结合安全性概念的辅助起始状态分布，可显著提升在线强化学习的样本效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Motivation: 解决现有4位量化方法需要预处理或性能不足的问题，提供更高效且无需预处理的量化方案。

Method: 使用任意数值表示（any4）进行量化，无需权重或激活的预处理，并通过GPU优化的矩阵乘法库tinygemm实现。

Result: any4在多种模型（Llama 2、Llama 3、Mistral、Mixtral）上表现优于其他4位量化方法，且校准仅需单个样本。

Conclusion: any4是一种高效、无需预处理的4位量化方法，适用于多种LLM，并开源了相关代码和工具。

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large
language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without
requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy
compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息论的扩散模型采样方法（IGDS），通过优化原型信息和上下文信息，提升低IPC设置下的数据集蒸馏性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在低IPC（每类图像数）设置下生成的样本多样性不足，影响了数据集蒸馏的效果。

Method: 从信息论角度定义并最大化原型信息I(X;Y)和上下文信息H(X|Y)，提出IGDS方法，通过变分估计实现。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上，IGDS显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC情况下。

Conclusion: IGDS方法有效解决了低IPC下的样本多样性问题，提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MLLM-SC框架能够实现上下文感知和任务导向的无线通信，为6G网络中的沉浸式应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格搜索调整自编码器隐藏层大小耗时耗力，需更高效的方法。

Method: 引入基于物理概念的自组织稀疏自编码器（SOSAE），通过惩罚特征向量的幅度和位置索引，动态优化特征空间维度。

Result: 在多种数据集上，SOSAE将特征空间维度调整的计算量减少至基线的1/130，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: SOSAE提供了一种高效且性能优越的自编码器特征空间优化方法。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 在合成和模拟数据集上，循环重建误差低于0.003，评估指标比基线模型提升约30%。

Conclusion: 该框架支持无监督学习，减少人工干预，在非单射回归任务中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Conclusion: HAS-CGAN有效解决UPM中数据稀缺问题，显著提升粗糙度预测精度。

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is
critical for real-time quality control, but small datasets hinder model

excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting
training data with 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4%

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上优于现有NAS方法，并能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE为神经架构搜索提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了性能和部署效率。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多媒体等领域表现出色，但幻觉问题限制了其可信度和应用潜力。现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理，增加了推理时间。

Method: 提出SEED方法，通过识别和消除LVLM内部知识中的幻觉，蒸馏纯化后的知识回模型，实现自进化；引入Mode-Seeking Evolving方法避免输出空间的空洞问题；设计Hallucination Elimination Adapter校正原始模型的暗知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SEED的优越性，显著减轻了LLaVA-1.5和InternVL2等模型的幻觉问题，POPE-Random指标F1分数从81.3提升至88.3。

Conclusion: SEED方法有效解决了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能，且不增加推理时间。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现神经网络训练中权重无界增长导致塑性损失，影响泛化能力和优化动态。重新初始化网络会丢失信息，因此需要新方法。

Method: 提出SWR方法，通过逐步缩放权重防止无界增长，同时保留学习信息。

Result: 理论证明SWR能限制权重幅度并平衡层间权重。实验表明SWR在多种学习任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: SWR有效解决塑性损失问题，提升神经网络性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，解决了KANs的高计算成本和性能问题，在函数回归任务中表现优异，但在图像和文本分类中需谨慎调整参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs因其可学习的单变量函数替代固定激活函数而受到关注，但存在高计算成本和性能不足的问题，MJKAN旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: MJKAN整合了FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构，结合KANs的非线性表达能力和MLPs的高效性。

Result: MJKAN在函数回归任务中表现优于MLPs，但在图像和文本分类中需调整基础函数数量以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KANs的理论优势，同时提高了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

*Daichi Mukunoki,Shun-ichiro Hayashi,Tetsuya Hoshino,Takahiro Katagiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 评估通用大型语言模型（LLM）在生成CPU上的基本线性代数子程序（BLAS）代码的能力，发现即使仅提供例程名称，也能生成正确代码，并能实现性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在自动生成高性能BLAS代码方面的潜力，以验证其在实际应用中的可行性。

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4.1和o4-mini模型，从例程名称或Fortran参考代码生成C代码，并进行性能优化（如线程并行化、SIMD向量化和缓存块化）。

Result: 多数情况下能生成正确代码，优化后的代码性能优于参考代码。

Conclusion: LLM在BLAS代码生成和优化方面具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanMind是一个基于C-RAG-LLM架构的工具增强检索生成框架，旨在实现城市通用智能（UGI），通过动态整合领域知识和城市数据支持长期适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统在动态复杂城市环境中自主感知、推理和行动的挑战，推动通用LLM代理在未来城市中的应用。

Method: 采用C-RAG-LLM架构，结合多级优化框架和增量语料更新机制，支持端到端或分层优化。

Result: 在多种复杂度的真实城市任务中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: UrbanMind为实现未来城市中的通用LLM代理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对虚拟智能体需求的增长，世界模型成为研究热点，但对其定义、构建和评估仍存在争议。

Method: 通过批判现有理论，提出了一种基于分层、多级和混合表示的新架构，并结合生成和自我监督学习框架。

Result: 提出了一种通用的世界模型架构，支持对现实世界所有可行可能性的模拟。

Conclusion: 世界模型的目标是为有目的的推理和行动模拟现实世界的所有可能性，PAN AGI系统是其潜在应用。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究归一化层在卷积架构中对空间信息传递的影响，特别是在需要局部感受野的任务中。

Method: 通过玩具定位任务和卷积架构，研究归一化层如何实现迭代消息传递和信息聚合。

Result: 归一化层能实现超出局部感受野的信息传递。

Conclusion: 在需要保持有限感受野的应用中（如基于扩散的轨迹生成），应谨慎使用归一化层。

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree
of communication across the spatial dimensions of an input tensor. We study a
toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

*Joschka Braun,Bálint Mucsányi,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过直接重新加权主题相关标记的logits来增强摘要的主题相关性，避免了资源密集的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的抽象摘要对语言模型仍具挑战性，现有方法如微调资源消耗大，而提示工程难以保持主题聚焦。

Method: 提出三种logits重新加权技术：常量偏移、因子缩放和阈值选择，以增强主题相关性。

Result: 在NEWTS数据集上的实验表明，这些技术有效增加了主题相关词汇的使用，尤其是阈值选择方法在不降低摘要质量的情况下提升了主题聚焦。

Conclusion: 直接重新加权logits是一种实用且资源高效的替代微调方法，为精确控制生成文本的主题内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPall是一个联邦学习框架，通过原型对抗学习和协作学习解决特征漂移问题，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据异构性（特别是特征漂移）在联邦学习中影响模型性能，但现有研究较少关注。

Method: 利用原型对抗学习统一特征空间，通过协作学习增强类信息，并混合全局原型和局部特征以优化分类器。

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上，FedPall表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FedPall有效解决了联邦学习中的特征漂移问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

*Jiashu Tao,Reza Shokri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种通过解释信号（如输入特征）在小数据集上训练可靠分类模型的方法，采用两阶段训练循环提升模型准确性和注意力匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模标记数据获取和训练成本高，小数据集易导致模型结果不稳定、过拟合和虚假相关性学习。现有标签缺乏分类依据，模型可能学习任意规则。

Method: 两阶段训练循环：交替提升预测准确性和注意力匹配解释信号，使模型学习标签分配的依据。

Result: 方法加速模型收敛，提升在小规模、类别不平衡或含虚假特征数据上的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过解释信号指导训练，可在小数据集上构建更准确和可靠的分类模型。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Motivation: 冷启动节点分类在多模态图中具有挑战性，因为节点孤立且模态常缺失，现有方法因降级为MLP而容量受限。

Method: NTSFormer通过冷启动注意力掩码同时生成基于自信息和邻居信息的预测，利用Transformer处理缺失模态，并通过多模态图预计算和MoE输入投影实现有效融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NTSFormer在多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自学习和多模态融合，有效解决了冷启动节点的孤立性和模态缺失问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了深度强化学习（DRL）供应链中的关键漏洞，提出了两种新型后门攻击方法，挑战了现有研究对训练时攻击的过度关注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL系统在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但其安全性研究不足，尤其是后门攻击。现有研究仅关注训练时攻击，忽略了供应链中的其他漏洞。

Method: 提出了两种攻击方法：TrojanentRL（利用组件级漏洞植入持久后门）和InfrectroRL（无需训练数据的后训练攻击）。

Result: 在六种Atari环境中验证，攻击效果与最先进的训练时攻击相当，且InfrectroRL能规避两种主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前研究重点，强调了开发更鲁棒防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Motivation: 解决语言模型在客户语音应用中实现自然对话风格和遵循特定风格指南的挑战。

Method: 使用LoRA微调开源模型（Llama3.2-1B-Instruct）和闭源模型（gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini），基于合成数据集。

Result: 微调优于系统提示，仅需100样本即可实现高对话响应率，且内容质量未下降。8位整数量化收敛更快。

Conclusion: 微调小型开源模型是高效且数据节约的方法，优于复杂系统提示，适用于需要特定风格的实用场景。

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Motivation: 现实应用中数据标注成本差异和预算限制阻碍了主动学习的应用，因此需要开发适应这些约束的策略。

Method: 使用贝叶斯神经网络计算不确定性指标，动态阈值策略重新分配预算，贪婪策略逐步选择样本。

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上，ConBatch-BAL策略优于随机基线，甚至超越无约束方案。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略能有效减少标注成本和迭代次数，适用于高成本标注场景。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Method: 结合PrimeSeq特征提取、ESMonehot编码和增强门控注意力机制的多实例深度学习框架。

Result: 模型在SLE和RA诊断中分别达到98.95%和97.76%的AUC，并成功识别疾病相关基因。

Conclusion: EAMil为自身免疫疾病的检测和分类提供了可解释且具有广泛临床应用潜力的新方法。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心策划的数据集集合训练的变换器模型仍能有效进行上下文预测，并提供额外的灵活性优势。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering

### [670] [Beyond Scaling Curves: Internal Dynamics of Neural Networks Through the NTK Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05035)
*Konstantin Nikolaou,Sven Krippendorf,Samuel Tovey,Christian Holm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过神经切线核（NTK）分析神经网络在数据和模型规模扩展下的行为，揭示了性能扩展与内部动态的联系，并指出性能扩展不足以理解神经网络机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络性能与计算成本关系的缩放规律，但其机制尚不明确，希望通过NTK视角深入理解。

Method: 通过实验分析数据和模型规模扩展下神经网络的行为，利用NTK建立性能扩展与内部动态的联系。

Result: 发现即使内部动态相反，性能扩展指数仍相似；确定了支持特征学习的最大模型宽度。

Conclusion: 性能扩展不能完全解释神经网络机制，需结合内部动态分析；特征学习在有限宽度模型中存在过渡区。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过将推理时的额外计算转化为与状态化工具的多轮交互，提升大语言模型在修复Python代码任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，大语言模型在推理时通过自然语言表达“思考”来消耗额外计算，但效率较低。本文旨在通过多轮交互和状态化工具优化这一过程。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RLVR）训练模型，将推理时的计算转化为与工具的多轮交互，使用自定义DSL控制工具状态。

Result: 在修复Python代码的任务中，该方法实现了更快的采样和更密集的奖励信号，使3B参数的模型也能高效利用额外计算。

Conclusion: 通过多轮交互和状态化工具，可以显著提升大语言模型在特定任务中的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在高维数据中调整线性回归的正则化超参数的方法，提出了在多任务场景下改进泛化误差的分布依赖边界，优于现有工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据中正则化超参数的调整对避免过拟合和保证变量选择的有效性至关重要，但现有泛化边界在特征维度增加时性能下降。

Method: 通过分析多任务线性回归中的L1和L2正则化（如岭回归、Lasso和弹性网络），提出分布依赖的泛化误差边界。

Result: 在子高斯分布等假设下，新边界不随特征维度增加而恶化，且在大维度下显著优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 新方法在数据分布“良好”时提供更紧的泛化边界，并扩展到岭回归的推广形式，进一步优化结果。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆测试中场景选择的代表性和多样性问题，避免人工标注和显式目标的偏见。

Method: 使用异质时空图模型表示交通场景，结合图神经网络和自监督学习，实现场景的聚类和相似性搜索。

Result: 实验证明模型能有效捕捉场景语义并形成有意义的聚类，支持无标签场景的代表性选择。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶测试提供了可扩展的场景选择基础，提升了测试效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

TL;DR: PRING是一个从图级别评估蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPI）预测的综合基准，填补了现有方法在重建生物意义网络能力上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注孤立成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义PPI网络的能力，而这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个高质量多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种互补评估范式：拓扑导向和功能导向任务。

Result: 实验表明当前PPI模型在恢复网络结构和功能特性上存在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

*Tobias Blickhan,Jules Berman,Andrew Stuart,Benjamin Peherstorfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICE方法是一种生成建模方法，通过学习有限时间点样本群体的演化来捕捉平滑的群体动态，而非复杂的个体轨迹动态。其损失函数具有不变性，提高了训练稳定性和鲁棒性，且生成样本速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉群体动态时可能因个体轨迹的复杂性而失效，DICE旨在解决这一问题，提供更稳定和高效的学习方式。

Method: DICE通过设计不变性损失函数，直接学习群体动态，避免时间条件采样，从而快速生成样本。

Result: DICE在多种问题（如随机波、Vlasov-Poisson不稳定性、高维混沌）中表现稳定，生成样本成本显著低于其他方法。

Conclusion: DICE是一种高效、稳定的生成建模方法，适用于捕捉群体动态，尤其在复杂系统中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KFAC在深度学习中有广泛应用，但其实现复杂且容易出错，作者希望通过提供测试用例和实现指南来帮助初学者更好地理解和应用KFAC。

Method: 通过结合数学和代码的并行展示，以及基于最新文献的测试用例，提供一个从基础到实现的KFAC教程。

Result: 提供了一个易于理解的KFAC教程，帮助初学者深入理解并降低实现难度。

Conclusion: 本文为初学者提供了KFAC的现代视角，旨在促进其在实践中的实现、扩展和应用。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Motivation: 传统方法需要大量数据，而本文通过数据增强和预训练，显著减少所需数据量，同时保持物理模型的严谨性。

Method: 采用二次神经网络近似物理模拟器，训练少量设备数据（约500个），实现高质量拟合。

Result: 在实验性WS2晶体管中，拟合效果优异（R²=0.99），并能同时拟合35个参数。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，为逆向晶体管设计提供了新的深度学习工具，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过硬件/软件紧密集成的框架，以支持在资源受限的TinyML硬件上运行神经符号AI（NSAI），重点在于高效计算符号模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在嵌入式场景中的局限性，如不确定性量化和显式规则推理，同时克服符号模型在TinyML硬件上的计算挑战。

Method: 1. 训练硬件高效的确定性概率电路（PCs）；2. 使用n次根压缩技术压缩PCs；3. 在TinyML硬件上部署完整的NSAI模型。

Result: 相比64位精度基线，硬件资源显著减少（FPGA上FF减少82.3%，LUT减少52.6%，Flash减少18.0%），ESP32微控制器上的推理速度平均提升4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了在资源受限的TinyML硬件上高效运行NSAI，为嵌入式场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Motivation: 解决随机场模型中连续和分类变量混合时的重建问题，提高不确定性量化任务的效率。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

TL;DR: 论文提出“训练-测试”方法，通过统一微调模型以减少基准测试中的排名矛盾，显著提升排名一致性和外部有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试的排名矛盾阻碍模型选择和比较，需要一种解决方案。

Method: 采用“训练-测试”方法，对61个模型在24个基准测试上进行统一微调后评估。

Result: 该方法显著提升排名一致性，减少模型间差异，并揭示基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将“训练-测试”作为语言模型基准测试的默认步骤。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Result: 揭示了孤立预测任务的局限性，为干预导向的ADS开发与部署奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 需转向干预范式，以更有效地设计和评估ADS在社会系统中的影响。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合推断工具仅针对均值或单一分位数，限制了其在关键领域的适用性。

Result: 实验证明QuEst在经济建模、民意调查和语言模型自评估中具有实用性。

Conclusion: QuEst扩展了混合推断工具的功能，适用于更多关键领域。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cascade的新型多方推理协议，通过序列维度分片来平衡隐私保护与性能，解决了现有安全方案（如SMPC）的高开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型参数规模的增长，计算资源需求限制了其可用性，第三方推理服务兴起，但隐私问题突出。现有安全方案（如SMPC）开销大且难以扩展。

Method: 提出Cascade协议，利用序列维度分片技术，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证以提升性能和可扩展性。

Result: Cascade能抵抗现有攻击（包括统计隐私方案和学习型攻击），且速度比现有方案快多个数量级。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代大语言模型的安全部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习在GWAS中的应用，通过改进架构选择和避免数据泄漏，提升了多疾病分析的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GWAS常忽略非线性遗传交互作用，而现有深度学习方法依赖特征选择策略，可能引入数据泄漏或局限于已知通路。

Method: 研究了不同深度学习架构选择，并扩展为多标签框架，联合建模五种疾病，利用共享遗传结构提高效率。

Result: 在37000样本和五百万SNPs上，方法实现了竞争性预测性能（AUC 0.68-0.96）。

Conclusion: 该方法为多疾病GWAS分析提供了可扩展、无泄漏且具有生物学意义的新途径。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
