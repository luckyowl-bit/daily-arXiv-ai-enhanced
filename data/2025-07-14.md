Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario

*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合提示专家评估和自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病识别的准确性和治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要提高精准农业中的图像分析可靠性。

Method: 1. 基于提示的专家评估协议；2. 余弦一致性自投票机制，生成多候选响应并选择最语义一致的诊断。

Result: 玉米叶病识别准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中支持实时决策，展示了AI驱动精准农业工具的潜力。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: This paper outlines the development of a Canada-wide morphology map
classifying regions into residential, urban low-rise, and urban high-rise
environments, following the ITU-R P.1411-12 propagation model guidelines. To

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并揭示了这些模型在生成简单二进制图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLMs和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过创建新数据集，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，再通过文本到图像模型生成图像，最后用GPT-4比较描述差异。

Result: 模型在生成简单二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。本文旨在通过数据驱动的方法优化初始化。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为领域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束关系，提出无需训练的闭式权重估计方法，并支持可变秩。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解等任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动的初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA通过优化初始化显著提升了LoRA微调的性能和收敛速度，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要进一步提升效率和性能。

Method: HML-ELM采用两阶段框架：1）基于ELM-AE的无监督特征提取；2）基于SIT2-FELM的监督分类。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在图像分类和无人机任务中优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且性能优越的图像分类方法，适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布或Beta分布）的效果，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小规模计算环境下进行，结果对算法在不同噪声条件下的表现提出了挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声时的性能表现，而非调整算法以适应噪声类型，以探索算法的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声替代原始高斯噪声，并在小规模计算环境下进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，算法在非高斯噪声条件下的性能表现与高斯噪声条件下存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 算法在高斯噪声条件下表现良好，但在非高斯噪声条件下可能需要进一步调整或改进。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的单幅VHR SAR图像建筑物高度估计方法，通过边界框检测和高度回归实现，在多大陆数据集上验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率SAR图像在城市应用中至关重要，但现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上表现不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的物体回归方法，利用深度学习和交叉验证策略评估泛化能力。

Result: 在欧洲城市表现最佳（MAE约2.20米），显著优于现有方法，但在亚洲等高楼密集区域泛化能力有所下降。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单幅VHR SAR图像的建筑物高度估计中具有强大的跨城市和跨大陆泛化潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯注册的框架，用于重建未定位的稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合注册模块实现高保真对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以整合更多视图。

Method: 使用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输Mixture 2-Wasserstein距离，设计联合注册模块整合多种约束。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐，精确估计相机位姿并生成高质量新视图。

Conclusion: RegGS有效解决了稀疏视图下的3D高斯对齐问题，为未定位图像重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，导致在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断被遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文以增强视频序列的连贯性。

Result: 在挑战性单目视频上验证，显示处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 无模板策略适应多变条件，显著提升动态场景细节恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉障碍者在孟加拉国城市通勤时面临大量障碍物和交通事故风险，亟需一种能够提前预警的系统。

Result: 提出的解决方案实现了轻量级实时深度估计和物体检测模型，mAP50达到0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统有效帮助视觉障碍者避开障碍物，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Hartley变换的HNOSeg-XS架构，用于解决医学图像分割中CNN和Transformer模型在分辨率鲁棒性、计算效率和内存占用方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中各有局限：CNN因局部感受野和计算成本高导致长距离空间相关性捕获不足；Transformer因二次复杂度计算需求大。两者在输入尺寸缩减时可能导致次优结果。

Method: 通过傅里叶神经算子建模可学习偏微分方程，利用Hartley变换替代傅里叶变换，在频域重构问题，提出HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在BraTS'23、KiTS'23和MVSeg'23数据集上，HNOSeg-XS表现出卓越的分辨率鲁棒性，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种分辨率鲁棒、高效且参数极少的医学图像分割模型，优于传统CNN和Transformer方法。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D在实例参数化维度和体素分辨率耦合上的问题，同时提升生物医学图像中实例分割的性能。

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，采用闭合表面表示实例，使用双三次Bézier三角形补丁，支持高分辨率预测。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于StarDist-3D，尤其适用于生物医学图像中的斑点状实例。

Conclusion: SurfDist展示了可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

density maps, indicating the framework's potential extension to localization
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用。

Method: PBL包括智能手机应用和生物力学模型拟合算法，通过大样本临床数据验证。

Result: 关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且敏感，与临床评分相关。

Conclusion: 智能手机视频可作为低负担工具，用于临床生物力学数据采集。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型SAR目标检测方法CR-Net，结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了跨分辨率检测中的域适应问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率提升导致散射特性差异增大，传统目标检测模型泛化能力受限，域适应技术因分辨率差异导致特征适应不可靠。

Method: CR-Net结合SHFA模块（结构感知特征适应）和RSAA模块（可靠语义对齐），通过结构先验和证据学习理论优化域适应过程。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，显著提升了跨分辨率域适应性能。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法在稳定、细粒度运动场表示上存在局限性，导致运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透等渲染伪影。

Method: 提出三步框架：视频预处理、运动表示和渲染重建，包括多粒度运动解耦策略和交替优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，生成质量提升2.43 dB PSNR，用户评价视频真实感提升0.64，推理速度达150 FPS。

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过改进运动建模和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的视觉效果和效率。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Result: 在40名志愿者的数据集上实验，取得了令人满意的识别效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为颅面重建提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得显著进展，但其在临床实践中的应用受限于模型的大规模和缺乏透明度。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层中最相关的部分，实现有针对性的压缩，同时保持临床有意义的表示。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗环境中轻量级、可解释模型的部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 解决传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索的问题，提升模型的解释性和组合性。

Method: 利用扩散能量函数引导，通过显式概念传递信息，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定）。

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上实验，CoCo-Bot在概念级可控性和可解释性上表现优异，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗扰动注入，显著提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，通过自我验证预测和增强上下文对齐，改进了基于上下文学习(ICL)的医学图像分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于标注医学图像的稀缺性和计算成本，选择最优的上下文图像-掩码对具有挑战性，且无法对基础ICL模型进行微调。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，然后交换查询图像和上下文对角色以验证预测准确性，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，CCV优于现有方法，显著提升了ICL分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的通用医学图像分割解决方案，能够有效增强基于ICL的分割效果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 旨在评估大语言模型在无需专门训练的情况下，能否通过提示策略完成复杂的交通场景解释任务，为老年驾驶员风险评估提供支持工具。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，以人类标注为基准，评估模型在三个任务中的表现，使用精确率、召回率和F1分数作为指标。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精确率高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计的提示，大语言模型有望成为驾驶风险评估的支持工具，未来需探索更大数据集和下一代模型架构的扩展性。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和GEFU任务（分类、检测、语义分割）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU为低光视觉任务提供了一种泛化性强且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Result: 数据集展示了细粒度类别、密集重叠对象和全画布空间分布等挑战性特性，并通过基线分析验证了其难度。

Conclusion: ODOR数据集为艺术对象检测和嗅觉感知交叉研究提供了新挑战，推动了视觉文化遗产领域的进展。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

TL;DR: CoDi框架通过两阶段策略（身份传输和身份细化）实现主题一致且姿势多样的文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在保持主题一致时牺牲布局和姿势多样性的问题。

Method: 采用身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR）两阶段策略，利用扩散模型的渐进特性。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过统一的2D位移估计框架支持多任务，无需特定任务架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架实现多任务集成，提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的特征提取和转换管道，预训练跨域数据集。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: PanMatch通过统一框架和强大特征提取器，实现了多任务的高效集成和零样本匹配能力。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语义哈希中心（SHC）的深度哈希方法，通过保留类别间的语义关系，显著提升了大规模图像检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的哈希中心忽略了类别间的语义关系，可能影响检索性能。SHC通过语义相关的哈希中心改进这一问题。

Method: SHC框架分为三阶段：1) 使用分类网络计算语义相似性；2) 优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3) 训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升了7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效提升了检索性能，验证了语义关系在哈希生成中的重要性。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP是一种新的条件提示学习范式，通过多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，并结合视觉条件提示和上下文提示，提升视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提示学习中类嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 提出MuGCP，利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，引入注意力互导模块生成视觉条件提示，并通过多提示融合机制整合提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态互导和提示融合，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

TL;DR: InstaScene提出了一种新的3D感知范式，旨在分解复杂场景中的实例并实现完整重建。通过空间对比学习和原位生成技术，该方法在分解和补全物体方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够自然地识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视角中的光栅化来增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观测和几何线索引导3D生成模型补全物体。

Result: 在复杂真实和合成场景中，该方法在场景分解和物体补全方面表现优异，实现了高分解精度和几何保真度。

Conclusion: InstaScene为复杂场景的3D感知提供了新范式，显著提升了分解和补全能力。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU是一种无需训练的空间维度加速框架，通过混合分辨率采样和噪声时间重调度，显著减少计算量，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器计算量大，阻碍实际部署，现有方法主要优化时间维度，缺乏空间维度的高效加速方案。

Method: RALU分三阶段进行混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节优化，结合噪声时间重调度稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX和Stable Diffusion 3上分别实现7.0倍和3.0倍加速，图像质量损失极小。

Conclusion: RALU与现有时间加速方法互补，可无缝集成进一步降低延迟且不牺牲生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了修复场景的几何保真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D场景修复中的视角不一致问题，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Motivation: 探索在预训练视觉基础模型上直接构建图像分词器的方向，这是一个尚未充分研究的领域。

Method: 采用冻结的视觉基础模型作为分词器的编码器，引入区域自适应量化框架和语义重建目标。

Result: VFMTok在图像重建和生成质量上取得显著提升，gFID达到2.07，加速模型收敛三倍，无需分类器自由指导即可实现高保真类条件合成。

Conclusion: VFMTok通过创新设计在图像分词任务中表现出色，代码将公开以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习在3D重建中展现出广阔应用前景，但需解决模型精度、可扩展性和动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法为设计文档识别系统提供了新思路，并为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一种基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，结合解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征显著提高检索特异性，APE支持基于位置的搜索。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学图像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在目标分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉目标跟踪的SOTA。本文提出用强化学习优化其内存更新，替代手工规则，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则处理干扰、遮挡和运动，效果有限。本文探索强化学习在内存控制中的潜力。

Result: 在单视频过拟合实验中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无配对图像翻译方法在语义分割任务中无法保证语义匹配的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级翻译函数估计像素级输入变换参数，并通过多尺度判别器确保翻译结果的真实性。

Result: 在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中表现优于传统GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在低数据量情况下有效解决了语义匹配问题，提升了语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的精细度。

Method: 提出DISC方法，用区分性类别查询替代体素查询，并结合类别特性设计专门的解码模块。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55。

Conclusion: DISC显著提升了实例类别的性能，优于现有单帧和多帧方法。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA方法，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的适应问题，通过贝叶斯框架实现预测一致性和动态表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理时间演化分布偏移时存在缺陷，如有限内存缓存、不可靠的熵置信度和静态视觉表征。

Method: BayesTTA通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和校准推理，动态对齐视觉表征。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移问题，提升了模型适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,

automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多帧BEV特征结合受物体运动影响，性能提升有限，需解决时间对齐问题。

Method: 使用MBFNet动态对齐BEV特征，并引入时间一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时间对齐和循环结构，实现了相机3D检测任务的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Motivation: 传统手动收集和标注图像数据集耗时且低效，而AI生成的数据不如真实数据有价值。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能高效构建高质量真实世界图像数据集，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI虽然分辨率高，但成本昂贵且稀缺，且存在易感性伪影等问题。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以降低对实际7T扫描的依赖。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1W图像配对7T T1图），分为训练、验证和测试集。模型通过Transformer架构实现，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM显著优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效合成7T质量的T1图，优于现有技术，使7T MRI的优势更易应用于临床工作流程。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，多个MLLM的性能均得到提升。

Conclusion: 深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效，方法轻量且兼容黑盒模型。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Conclusion: MoSAiC在多模态卫星影像中实现了更精细的语义解耦和更鲁棒的表示学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for

which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To

matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Conclusion: SGPMIL通过不确定性量化提升了MIL框架的性能和可解释性，适用于数字病理学等场景。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer

Result: 提供了包括车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD填补了现有数据集的不足，为智能城市应用提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，提出一种基于STV特征的集成学习方法。

Method: 使用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征与总变分次梯度的非线性特征函数相关，能有效表征多尺度纹理。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV集成方法（AUC=0.87）优于神经网络（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其在CT图像的精细尺度特征对PET高摄取预测有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Result: HieraRS能够生成分层预测，提升语义一致性和分类精度，并有效适应异构层次结构。

Conclusion: HieraRS为遥感影像分层分类提供了灵活且通用的解决方案，支持多粒度预测和跨域迁移。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在多样城市场景中表现优于基线，几何误差更低，泛化能力更强，通信开销大幅减少。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为灵活、情境感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，框架已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Birkhoff的无数据压缩算法，用于压缩Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，具有高效、通用和紧凑的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中表现出色，广泛应用于医疗和智能制造等领域，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: Birkhoff采用Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转化为低维标量，并设计了HyperLinear算子加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能保持和推理速度上表现优异，例如在SAM2-B上实现了5.17倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，且无需微调数据。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和足够的原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，模型在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的细节表现、部分独立性和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Motivation: 传统渲染方法在数据压缩和计算效率上存在不足，CLiFTs旨在通过压缩令牌保留场景的丰富外观和几何信息，同时提供灵活的计算预算控制。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机姿态转换为令牌，通过潜在空间K均值选择减少的射线集作为聚类中心，多视图“冷凝器”将所有令牌信息压缩为中心令牌以构建CLiFTs。测试时根据目标视角和计算预算收集附近令牌，利用计算自适应渲染器合成新视角。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上的实验表明，该方法在数据压缩、渲染质量和速度之间取得平衡，实现了显著的数据减少和高质量渲染。

Conclusion: CLiFTs提供了一种高效且灵活的神经渲染解决方案，适用于动态调整计算预算的场景，同时保持高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练，性能媲美EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过轻量级改进和高效训练，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了基于提示的文本转语音模型的不可控变异问题，提高了模型的可控性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Conclusion: MedicalBERT展示了预训练BERT模型在生物医学NLP任务中的潜力，验证了迁移学习的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question

### [74] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

TL;DR: 大规模实证分析表明，越狱攻击的复杂性并未显著高于正常对话，且攻击毒性和复杂性随时间稳定，而AI安全机制在改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究越狱攻击的复杂性和演变，以支持AI安全性。

Method: 分析200多万真实对话，使用多种复杂性指标（概率、词汇多样性、压缩比、认知负荷）。

Result: 越狱攻击复杂性未显著高于正常对话，攻击毒性和复杂性稳定，AI防御机制改进。

Conclusion: 越狱攻击的复杂性受人类创造力限制，防御措施持续进步，学术披露可能引发信息危害。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT在金融NLP任务中表现优异，尤其在分类任务（如情感分析和标题分类）上接近GPT-4，但在推理和生成任务（如问答和摘要）上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域的实际应用能力，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 在六个金融NLP任务上测试FinGPT，使用金融专用数据集并与GPT-4和人类基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强，但在推理和生成任务中表现不佳，尤其在数值准确性和复杂推理方面。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化架构和领域适应性。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计的观点，探索其内部工作机制，并提出机器理解的理论框架。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的内部结构，提出三层次理解模型：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解。

Result: LLMs能够形成类似理解的内部结构，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应将讨论从LLMs是否理解转向其独特工作机制的研究。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型高效识别和纠正自身错误的问题。

Method: 利用Process Reward Model（PRM）评估生成块，根据PRM分数动态调整掩码比例，针对性优化低分部分。

Result: 通过针对性优化，模型能更高效地改进生成文本的质量。

Conclusion: R3框架简单有效，可提升预训练模型在文本生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs在自动化招聘系统中的表现及其与人类专家的差异。

Method: 使用Claude、GPT和Gemini三种LLM，在不同公司背景下测试，并与三名人类专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类专家差异显著；GPT适应性最强，Gemini次之，Claude最弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释的模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎部署于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域取得成功，但其嵌入空间的中毒攻击风险未被充分研究，尤其是绕过安全对齐机制的针对性攻击。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换在嵌入空间识别和减弱毒性敏感维度，无需微调或训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%，并能泛化到安全增强模型。

Conclusion: 当前对齐策略存在关键漏洞，需开发嵌入感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Conclusion: 通过外部和内部分析的双重视角，本文为理解多模态ICL提供了新见解，提出的方法和指标可推广到更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

Motivation: 探究LLM政治倾向的成因及其影响。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数分析七种主流LLM。

Result: 多数模型优先考虑自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调会增强这一倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映了集体推理的新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

Method: 随机分配37,000名申请者至传统或AI辅助招聘流程，比较最终面试通过率和后续就业情况。

Result: AI辅助流程通过率提高20个百分点，就业概率高5.9个百分点，但偏向年轻、经验少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI技术提升招聘效率，但需关注其选择偏好和潜在影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医学应用中免责声明的使用情况，以确保用户意识到AI输出未经专业审核。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛查模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%降至2025年的0.97%，从2023年的19.6%降至2025年的1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力增强，免责声明应作为安全措施，根据临床上下文动态调整。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Method: 采用零样本和少量样本学习范式，对五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康理解任务中进行系统评估。

Result: SLMs在二进制分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数相差2%），但在多类任务中表现下降30%。少量样本学习对SLMs提升显著（14.6%），而LLMs提升不稳定。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康理解任务中表现出色，尤其是通过少量样本学习快速适应，适合作为隐私保护工具用于敏感数据分析。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统提供了可能，支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用价值、挑战及研究空白，以促进其更好地服务于医疗实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的研究进展和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图、多分辨率成像或电子健康记录集成，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生调查显示仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: 尽管MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，才能实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

TL;DR: AblationBench是一个用于评估语言模型代理在消融实验规划任务中的基准套件，包含两个任务：AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation。实验表明当前前沿语言模型在这些任务上表现有限，最佳系统仅识别29%的原始消融实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持或自动化研究过程中的消融实验设计，提升AI在科学研究中的应用。

Method: 开发AblationBench基准套件，包含两个任务，并基于语言模型设计自动评估框架。

Result: 前沿语言模型在任务中表现有限，最佳系统仅识别29%的原始消融实验，链式思维提示优于现有代理方法。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在消融实验规划任务中仍有挑战，链式思维提示显示出潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中高效恢复状态是一个关键挑战，现有固定压缩策略忽略了对话特定的注意力动态，导致准确性下降。

Method: Krul动态选择压缩策略，引入预压缩策略选择器、异构注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: 实验表明，Krul在TTFT和KV缓存存储上分别减少了1.5x-2.68x和1.33x-2.35x，且不损失生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul通过动态策略和优化恢复流程，显著提升了多轮对话的效率和质量。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

*Sebastian Walter,Hannah Bast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需微调的大语言模型方法，用于从自然语言问题或关键词查询生成SPARQL查询，在多个知识图谱和基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对语言模型进行微调的需求。

Method: 利用大语言模型通过策略性执行SPARQL查询和搜索相关IRIs与字面量来探索知识图谱。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零样本设置的SOTA结果，在Freebase上接近最佳少样本方法，其他知识图谱上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种知识图谱和语言模型上表现优异，展示了无需微调的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的广泛应用受到安全性、可解释性和偏见等问题的限制，需要一种透明、可审计的方法来负责任地利用LM。

Method: 提出了一种框架，声明静态类型的LM子程序，记录所有LM生成的工件（如提示、输入、输出和数据依赖），并打包为库以支持采用和持续开发。

Result: 在公共评论处理（如NEPA要求的）中评估了框架，开发了“CommentNEPA”应用，其输出与人工标注的历史数据进行了定量比较。

Conclusion: 该框架为透明、可审计地使用LM提供了可行方案，适用于多个实际决策工作流程，如医疗和法律领域。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、与查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，显著减少内存负担，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中长上下文生成时KV缓存内存占用过高的问题，以提升吞吐量和降低服务成本。

Method: 采用近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，提出上下文校准压缩方法，推断最大压缩比。

Result: 在合成和实际任务中，Compactor保留一半令牌即可达到竞争方法性能，KV内存负担平均减少63%。

Conclusion: Compactor在多种任务和模型上表现出高效性和通用性，显著优化了KV缓存的内存占用。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大型语言模型（LLM）到小型语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，重点保留LLM中的共情能力，并通过两阶段微调和特定提示显著提升SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的场景（如智能手机）中，SLM需要保留LLM的共情能力以支持高质量人机交互。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程，结合从LLM提取的共情对话数据集，并设计四组特定提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 经过优化的SLM在生成共情回应时胜率高达90%，比基础SLM显著提升，且特定提示比基础提示胜率高10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为资源受限场景下的高质量人机交互提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Motivation: 解决生成式大语言模型（LLM）输出不真实的问题，特别是在高风险场景下，加速相关研究并提高预测方法的可访问性。

Method: 开发TruthTorchLM库，整合多种真实性预测技术，支持本地和API模型，提供统一的生成、评估和校准接口。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为LLM输出真实性预测提供了全面且可扩展的工具，填补了现有工具集的不足。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调后为何能表现出超出分布的深度泛化能力（OOCR），以理解其安全可靠部署的关键能力。

Method: 通过LoRA微调添加恒定导向向量，并直接训练导向向量，研究其对OOCR的影响。

Result: 导向向量能提升任务性能并引发泛化，甚至在需要条件行为的任务（如模型后门）中也有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调过程中学习的内容，为LLMs为何能进行OOCR提供了简单解释。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为代理学生是否能准确模拟真实学生的行为和特征。

Method: 收集489项NAEP数据，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力对标。

Result: 强通用模型普遍优于学生平均水平，但模型和提示的匹配性影响表现。

Conclusion: 需制定新策略优化LLMs作为代理学生的选择和使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于或匹配当前最先进模型，token使用减少约30%。

Conclusion: KAT在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Method: 引入SSR范式，通过让模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和DIMT任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能同时提升模型的OCR和DIMT性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商商家在私域渠道（如即时通讯和电子邮件）中缺乏撰写有说服力文案的专业知识和工具，导致营销效果不佳。

Method: CRMAgent通过三种模式运作：基于群组的学习、检索与适应、以及基于规则的备用方案。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，以提升客户关系管理中的消息质量。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统探索如何充分发挥LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的潜力。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架能提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，常规方法效果有限；多语言对齐方法对LLMs有效，但对RLLMs效果不明显。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

TL;DR: 论文研究了自动评估指标（如ROUGE）在多语言生成任务中的适用性，发现其对语言类型敏感，并建议投资于神经评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨n-gram和神经评估指标在不同语言中的有效性，尤其是与人类评估的相关性。

Method: 设计了一个大规模评估套件，覆盖八种语言和四种语言类型，分析指标与人类判断的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中表现较差，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中存在局限性，建议优先使用神经评估指标。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调语言模型时，使用模型自身认为可信的生成数据比使用高质量事实数据更能减少幻觉现象。


<details>

Motivation: 语言模型容易产生事实错误的幻觉，微调高质量数据可能减少幻觉，但获取高质量数据成本高且可能导致更多下游幻觉。

Method: 研究微调数据的真实性对长文本生成任务中幻觉的影响，比较不同数据配置的效果。

Result: 微调模型自身认为可信的生成数据比使用高质量事实数据更能减少幻觉，且模型内部判断的过滤策略效果最佳。

Conclusion: 模型自身的信念可以作为事实性的有力信号，跨领域适用。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在传播关联事实的连锁效应时难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: 通过从结构化知识库提取逻辑模式并与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联知识簇。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑后确保内部逻辑一致性，并在连锁效应处理上达到新SOTA。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能有效模拟群体决策过程，未来可应用于专家研讨会的决策支持。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Result: LLM在适当配置下可有效支持税务专业人员，提供法律依据，但当前原型尚无法完全自动化。

Conclusion: LLM在税务领域有潜力，但仍需整合结构化背景信息以解决隐性客户知识和特定文档处理的局限性。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM在LDA后校正阶段有实际价值，但并非在所有情况下都优于传统方法。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising

TL;DR: DocPolarBERT是一种布局感知的BERT模型，通过相对极坐标系统改进自注意力机制，无需绝对2D位置嵌入，在小规模预训练数据下实现最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档理解模型依赖绝对2D位置嵌入，计算复杂且数据需求高。DocPolarBERT旨在通过相对极坐标系统简化模型设计并减少数据依赖。

Method: 扩展自注意力机制，引入文本块在相对极坐标系中的位置信息，替代传统的笛卡尔坐标系。

Result: 在预训练数据量仅为IIT-CDIP六分之一的情况下，DocPolarBERT仍达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 精心设计的注意力机制可弥补预训练数据的不足，为文档理解提供高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document

We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative
polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being
pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used

demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for
reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for
document understanding.

*Marcin Pietroń,Rafał Olszowski,Jakub Gomułka,Filip Gampel,Andrzej Tomski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在公开论证分类数据库中的表现，测试了包括GPT、Llama和DeepSeek在内的多种模型，发现ChatGPT-4o和Deepseek-R1表现最佳，但也存在常见错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证挖掘（AM）是一个跨学科研究领域，近年来因大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步而显著发展。然而，缺乏对这些模型在公开论证分类数据库中表现的研究。

Method: 使用Args.me和UKP等多样化数据集，测试了GPT、Llama、DeepSeek等模型及其结合Chain-of-Thoughts算法的变体。

Result: ChatGPT-4o在论证分类基准测试中表现最佳，而Deepseek-R1在推理增强模型中表现最优。但仍存在常见错误。

Conclusion: 本文首次对LLMs在公开论证数据集中的表现进行了广泛分析，揭示了已知提示算法的弱点，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了自动语音识别（ASR）生成的转录文本对说话人归属任务的影响，发现ASR转录错误对性能影响较小，甚至可能优于人工转录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于现实场景中通常只有ASR生成的错误较多的转录文本，而此前研究多基于人工转录，需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过全面研究ASR转录错误对说话人归属性能的影响，分析ASR系统特性与归属性能的关系。

Result: 研究发现说话人归属对单词级转录错误具有较强鲁棒性，且恢复真实转录的目标与归属性能相关性较低。

Conclusion: 结论表明基于ASR转录的说话人归属性能与人工转录相当甚至更优，可能因ASR错误揭示了说话人特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

TL;DR: KELPS框架通过神经符号方法将非正式数学转化为机器可验证定理，解决了多语言平行语料库的瓶颈问题，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学形式化中因语料库数量和质量受限的瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过知识方程（KEs）将自然语言转化为形式语言（Lean、Coq、Isabelle），并定义严格规则保持语义和句法。

Result: 生成60,000+问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的句法准确率，优于Deepseek-V3和Herald。

Conclusion: KELPS框架有效提升数学形式化的准确性和效率，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱的动态知识融合框架（KGA），通过外向内聚和内向过滤路径，实现在测试时动态融合知识，无需参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数微调，易导致灾难性遗忘和泛化能力下降，且难以适应实时知识更新。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导的注意力模块（KGA），包含外向内聚和内向过滤路径，动态融合外部知识并过滤无关信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异性能，实现了与参数微调方法相当的知识融合效果。

Conclusion: KGA框架在无需参数更新的情况下，实现了动态知识融合，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）多为纯文本模型，忽略了软件开发中常用的视觉辅助工具（如图表和流程图），限制了代码生成的实用性和准确性。

Method: 开发了MM-Coder，结合视觉工作流和文本指令；构建了MMc-Instruct数据集用于多模态指令调优；提出了MMEval基准用于评估多模态代码生成。

Result: 评估显示，模型在精确捕捉视觉信息、遵循指令和高级编程知识方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder通过整合文本和视觉设计，旨在革新工业编程，使LLMs能够理解和实现复杂的多模态规范。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Motivation: 旨在通过简单干预提升小型语言模型的链式推理能力，避免复杂的持续干预或模型调整。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成的推理轨迹构建引导向量，直接作用于键值缓存，诱导模型进行多步推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理任务中提升了模型的表现和推理结构，且具有超参数稳定性和高效性。

Conclusion: 缓存引导是一种更稳健、实用的控制生成方法，优于传统激活引导技术。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Result: 系统在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均获得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合语义和结构表示，有效解决了表格问答中的挑战，并在实际任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的部署增加，如何防止越狱攻击成为重要问题。

Method: 采用动态Stackelberg博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为序贯扩展博弈，并提出“紫色代理”结合RRT进行对抗探索与防御。

Result: 该方法能主动模拟攻击轨迹并预防有害输出，为分析对抗动态提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为缓解LLM越狱风险提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Motivation: 传统博弈论假设完全理性，而LLM-Nash框架旨在捕捉有限理性，通过显式建模推理过程。

Method: 在提示空间中定义均衡，将行为视为LLM推理的输出。

Result: 推理均衡可能与传统纳什均衡不同，为LLM系统提供新的战略交互基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究认知约束和战略交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Result: 实验表明接地标准的选择对NeSy方法的效果至关重要。

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法为NeSy提供了灵活性和理论保证，平衡了表达能力和计算效率。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Motivation: 现有量子联邦学习框架多为单模态，难以应对现实任务中的多模态需求。

Method: 采用中间融合和量子纠缠的多模态方法，并引入缺失模态无关（MMA）机制以稳定训练。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态量子联邦学习方法显著优于现有技术，尤其在缺失模态情况下表现稳定。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的具体方向，以推动计算系统中创造性溯因推理的发展。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主LLM代理的工具使用能力引入了新的安全风险，包括用户和工具发起的威胁，需要统一的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感），设计策略驱动决策模型，并在定制沙盒环境中进行强化学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐代理显著提升了对安全威胁的抵抗力，同时保持了良性任务的高效用。

Conclusion: 安全与有效性可协同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 提出M2-Reasoning-7B模型，结合高质量数据生成（294.2K样本）和动态多任务训练策略（任务特定奖励）。

Result: 模型在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，尤其在通用和空间推理领域表现优异。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，显著提升了MLLMs的动态空间交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于时间和资源限制，手动获取伦理需求具有挑战性且优先级低，因此需要一种自动化方法来促进伦理需求在系统开发中的整合。

Method: 提出一个框架，在多智能体LLM环境中引入伦理倡导代理，该代理基于系统描述提供伦理问题的批评和输入。

Result: 案例研究表明，该框架能捕捉大部分研究人员在30分钟访谈中识别的伦理需求，并引入额外相关需求，但也存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推动伦理需求在工程过程中的广泛应用，但仍需人类反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Motivation: 解决自然语言输入到形式逻辑表示的挑战，提升推理的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 采用双层框架：高层任务抽象（LLM解析自然语言为结构化表示）和低层逻辑生成（LLM生成符号化工作流）。通过端到端双层优化联合优化两个阶段。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，准确率显著提升（最高40%），同时增强了透明度和错误追踪能力。

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了可信且系统化的推理能力，是迈向可信赖推理的重要一步。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医学概念、四种互补匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略，结合三层知识图谱（分类、临床特征、实例）。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。专家评估显示信息质量、推理和专业表达均有改进。

Conclusion: 该方法缩短了罕见病患者的“诊断旅程”，接近临床阈值0.90。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Result: 实验显示该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型能有效理解精细地图，提出将其整合到地理参考工作流程的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量语音指令数据集提供了一种高效且无需人工标注的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计需要复杂的迭代推理，现有的大语言模型（LLM）工作流难以保持任务连续性并生成可执行模型。

Method: 通过九角色MAS和双代理系统（2AS）对比实验，使用Design-State Graph（DSG）表示设计状态，评估JSON有效性、需求覆盖率等指标。

Result: MAS生成的设计图更详细（平均5-6节点），但需求覆盖率低（<20%），代码兼容性平均低于50%。2AS在特定设置下代码兼容性达100%。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理系统能增强设计细节，但需求覆盖和代码兼容性仍需改进。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步优化模型性能，通过验证器反馈使模型能够自我纠正推理错误。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）结合Lean 4验证器反馈，包括反馈令牌掩码和多轮验证器交互，优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其自然语言理解能力和高推理成本。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过LLM-Read代码提示实现程序化对话推理，减少外部迭代成本。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架有效提升了AI代理的推理效率和性能，并展示了在图像任务中的通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了数据不足和隐私问题，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，通过量化奖励学习点式绝对奖励，简化了离线或非策略数据的应用，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和REBEL只能从偏好对或相对信号学习，而在线方法如PPO和GRPO复杂且需要在线数据。QRPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: QRPO利用量化奖励回归KL正则化RL目标的闭式解，无需相对信号，且支持预计算扩展。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且在8B规模模型中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QRPO不仅简化了学习过程，还减少了长度偏差，展示了其在点式绝对奖励学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

*Pouria Mahdavinia,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoFaSGD是一种内存高效的大模型微调方法，通过动态低秩SVD近似动量，减少GPU内存需求，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型微调中AdamW等优化器内存占用高的问题，结合低秩梯度投影和动态子空间更新。

Method: 提出Momentum Factorized SGD（MoFaSGD），动态更新低秩SVD表示动量，支持高效谱归一化更新。

Result: 理论证明收敛性，实验显示内存减少（类似LoRA）且性能优于现有低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD在内存和性能间取得平衡，为大模型微调提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准优化器在PINNs中难以平衡损失项，尤其在刚性或病态系统中。

Method: 提出PDE感知优化器，根据PDE残差梯度方差调整参数更新。

Result: 在多个PDE上表现优于Adam和SOAP，收敛更平滑，误差更低。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知自适应有效提升PINNs训练稳定性，未来需扩展至更大架构和硬件。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Result: QRPINNs在理论和实验上均优于传统PINNs和自适应采样方法，尤其在高维PDE中。

Conclusion: QRPINNs是一种高效且稳定的方法，结合自适应采样可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM在大型城市风险预测中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in
large-scale urban risk prediction. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: Text-LENS在处理新项目时表现优异，适用于教育评估。

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据，为临床和辅助生活场景提供了无干扰情绪监测的早期基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living
conditions.

Conclusion: 论文旨在推动可扩展、自适应、可解释的异常检测系统研究，并倡导因果驱动的方法应对网络安全威胁。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Result: 实验显示在基准任务中推理准确性、多样性和探索效率均有提升。

Conclusion: CTRLS框架通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著提升了链式思维推理的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

Result: EvA攻击平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并设计了两种新攻击。

Conclusion: EvA揭示了攻击设计的潜在改进空间，适用于更广泛的攻击场景。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent

Conclusion: 基于物理粒子相互作用的新方法为生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will
open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and
training configurations at

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Conclusion: CA-QNN在动态云服务负载预测中表现出显著优势，为资源管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM为单细胞RNA-seq数据分析提供了高质量嵌入和强解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该方法为加速BPMN模型创建提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

TL;DR: 比较三种优化器（AdamW、Lion、Sophia）在LLM预训练中的表现，发现Sophia训练损失最低，Lion最快，AdamW下游任务表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化器对减少LLM预训练时间和提升模型性能至关重要，因此比较三种主流优化器的效果。

Method: 使用两种基础架构和单/多轮训练方法，通过Maximal Update Parametrization和小型代理模型调参。

Result: 三种优化器表现相近，Sophia训练损失最低，Lion最快，AdamW下游任务最优。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，选择需根据具体需求权衡。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需生成自然语言解释的直接评估稀疏编码器可解释性的方法，并与人类评估结果对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖自然语言解释，难以区分解释生成与潜在特征的实际可解释性。

Method: 改进现有方法，直接评估稀疏编码器的可解释性，避免自然语言解释的中间步骤。

Result: 新方法提供了更直接且标准化的评估，并与人类评估结果进行了对比。

Conclusion: 为改进稀疏编码器评估提供了建议，推动了更标准化的可解释性评估方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynBridge是一种基于双向流的生成模型，用于多任务反应预测，通过图到图的转换和离散流桥技术，实现了化学反应的高效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分布和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突变的，因此需要一种能够准确建模状态转换的方法。

Method: 提出SynBridge模型，采用图到图的转换网络架构和离散流桥技术，通过原子和键的离散状态捕获反应物和产物之间的双向化学转化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上进行了广泛实验，证明了模型在正向和逆向合成任务中的优越性能。

Conclusion: 结构化扩散在离散空间中对反应预测具有显著优势，SynBridge在化学反应预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Motivation: 移动设备上部署VLMs面临计算和能效挑战，需评估现有框架的性能瓶颈。

Method: 在OnePlus 13R上运行LLaVA-1.5 7B、MobileVLM-3B和Imp-v1.5 3B，测量CPU、GPU、NPU利用率、温度、推理时间、功耗和用户体验。

Result: CPU在令牌生成中被过度使用，GPU和NPU利用不足或饱和，影响设备响应性。

Conclusion: 当前部署框架存在硬件利用不均衡问题，需优化GPU和NPU的使用以提高性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

TL;DR: SFedKD通过多教师知识蒸馏解决SFL中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFL在异构环境中易发生灾难性遗忘，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏和细粒度权重分配策略。

Result: SFedKD有效缓解灾难性遗忘，性能优于现有FL方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD为SFL提供了一种高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Motivation: 在强化学习中，复杂目标的行为对齐通常需要精心设计奖励函数，这具有挑战性。

Method: 引入马尔可夫决策过程的代数视角，推广标准折扣和到其他递归聚合（如折扣最大值和夏普比率）。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化多样目标，适用于确定性和随机性场景。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和实际应用潜力，可无缝整合到基于值和行动者-评论家算法中。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有circRNA识别方法依赖RNA-seq数据，计算成本高且效率低，尤其在植物中缺乏通用性强的深度学习模型。

Method: CircFormerMoE框架包含剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务，基于Transformer和混合专家模型。

Result: 在10种植物基因数据上验证了模型有效性，能够发现未注释的circRNAs，并进行了可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的计算方法和工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略周围车辆不确定或激进行为带来的潜在风险，导致预测不够准确。

Method: 结合时空编码器和风险感知特征融合解码器，将风险势场嵌入时空特征表示中，并设计了风险缩放损失函数。

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上，平均预测误差分别降低了4.8%和31.2%，尤其在高风险场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于自动驾驶系统做出更稳健的决策。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

Motivation: 探索一种无需增加参数或数据量即可提升Transformer性能的方法，同时支持动态计算资源调整。

Method: 采用递归的块式自回归编码器（AbbIE），在潜在空间进行迭代，无需专用数据集或训练协议。

Result: AbbIE在零样本学习任务中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，且能动态适应任务复杂度。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径，尤其适合动态计算需求场景。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Conclusion: ADAPT为恶意软件检测中的概念漂移问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，而可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著节水，但缺乏采用率数据阻碍政策制定。

Method: 开发遥感框架，结合Sentinel-1卫星影像和地面数据，分类监测灌溉实践。

Result: 模型F1-score达78%，能在大规模农田中准确识别DSR，预测结果与政府数据高度相关。

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了监测可持续灌溉实践的工具，支持资源分配和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Result: 使用LoGIC微调后，BLEU得分达46，优于基线VLM的44；轻量级组件在无监督设置下BLEU得分为31，优于现有方法10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC在无监督图像描述任务中表现出色，为提升性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Motivation: 联邦学习中存在不平衡协变量偏移的挑战，现有方法常忽视这一问题，FedAKD旨在解决这一复杂异质性。

Method: FedAKD结合客户端和服务器更新，采用异步知识蒸馏策略，利用正确预测样本更新全局模型，同时保持客户端模型固定。

Result: 在公开数据集和真实EHR数据上，FedAKD显著提高了协作公平性、预测准确性，并促进了客户端参与。

Conclusion: FedAKD是一种简单有效的方法，能够在不平衡协变量偏移下实现协作公平性和高预测性能。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，显著降低长序列处理的计算成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长序列上计算成本高的问题，提出高效且性能不妥协的解决方案。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机频谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性效率的选择性注意力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，同时提升准确性。

Conclusion: WERSA为长上下文模型提供高效、低成本的解决方案，推动可持续和可扩展的AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于马氏距离的优化框架（MAD-OPT），将领域知识融入数据驱动的分析中，以提高热电厂中AI的适用性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热电厂中AI的采用率低，主要由于AI算法的黑盒特性及传统数据驱动分析中缺乏领域知识。

Method: 开发了MAD-OPT框架，通过马氏距离约束将领域知识引入数据分析，并应用于395 MW燃气轮机系统。

Result: MAD-OPT框架能估计不同环境条件下的最优工艺参数，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证了其鲁棒性。此外，框架还能估计超出设计功率限制的最优条件，结果与实际数据相符。

Conclusion: 研究表明，未结合领域知识的优化分析可能提供无效解，而MAD-OPT框架为热电厂安全采用AI提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆强化学习方法假设专家演示可用，且不适用于长时程或对抗性任务，限制了其实际应用。

Result: 在模拟和实际无人水面车辆实验中，SPLASH显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPLASH为从次优演示中学习复杂任务提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Motivation: 研究PMD中两种正则化技术的实际效果及其相互作用，填补理论研究和实证分析之间的空白。

Method: 在小型RL环境中运行超过50万次训练种子，分析距离项和MDP正则化的组合效果。

Result: 两种正则化技术可以部分替代，但精确组合对实现稳健性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在RL中开发更稳健算法的重要性，尤其是针对超参数敏感性的优化。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

Motivation: 测试时数据偏移是部署预测模型时的常见挑战，TTA虽能暂时适应，但模型最终会失效，需要一种方法来监控性能并预警。

Method: 扩展了基于序列测试的监控工具，使其适用于无标签测试数据且模型在测试时更新的场景。

Result: 提出的TTA监控框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中表现有效。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控框架能有效检测模型失效点，为模型维护提供统计严谨的解决方案。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Conclusion: 跟踪训练末期参数活动是缓解灾难性遗忘的有效策略。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习多层感知机（MLP）的自适应非线性向量自回归（NVAR）模型，解决了传统NVAR和储层计算（RC）在高噪声或高维数据中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NVAR和RC依赖固定的非线性结构（如多项式展开或随机特征映射），在高噪声或真实数据中适应性差，且在高维场景下计算成本高。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习的浅层MLP，通过梯度优化联合训练MLP和线性读出层，避免了对参数网格搜索的需求。

Result: 在无噪声和合成噪声条件下，自适应模型在预测精度和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动的非线性学习，提高了预测性能并简化了调参过程。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Motivation: 扩展量子傅里叶神经算子（QFNO）以支持更高维度和分布式计算，同时探索量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的潜力。

Method: 采用分区计算框架，结合量子态编码和变分优化，通过消息传递机制实现数据分布，并在PennyLane和PyTorch中实现。

Result: 在Burgers方程和Navier-Stokes方程中，PHQFNO达到经典FNO的精度，并在不可压缩Navier-Stokes中表现更优，同时对输入噪声具有更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的优势，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

Result: 在多个非线性PDE问题中表现优异，与先进SciML方法相当，并提供高效准确的DA结果。

Conclusion: CGKN框架统一了SciML和数据同化，为其他外环应用（如优化设计）提供了示例。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Result: 在NAPOLY+上评估，AutoSlim减少了40%的FPGA LUTs和30%的转换，并能扩展到比现有基准大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过剪枝有效降低了硬件资源消耗，同时解决了符号加速器的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由机制不可微分且不灵活，且稀疏模式不利于低资源条件下的加速。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了BlockFFN。

Method: 使用结合ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器实现灵活路由，设计CLS感知训练目标以提升稀疏性，并实现高效的加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在实验中表现优于其他MoE基线，实现了80%的TLS和70%的8-token CLS，加速内核在终端设备上实现了3.67倍的加速。

Conclusion: BlockFFN通过改进路由和稀疏性设计，显著提升了MoE模型的性能和加速效率，适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Conclusion: 需开发更可靠的LLM评估方法，作者发布了改进的奖励模型及训练数据。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Motivation: 风险规避强化学习（RaCRL）易导致保守探索和次优策略，需改进探索方式以兼顾奖励与安全。

Result: 实验证明ORAC能避免次优策略，显著提升奖励-成本权衡，适用于连续控制任务。

Conclusion: ORAC为风险规避强化学习提供了一种有效的探索策略，平衡了性能与安全性。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Motivation: 旨在揭示因果抽象在无限制对齐映射下的问题，挑战线性表示假设的普遍性。

Result: 研究发现无限制的因果抽象变得空洞，且非线性映射在任务失败时仍能实现高精度。

Conclusion: 因果抽象不足以支持机制可解释性，未来需研究信息编码假设与因果抽象的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Motivation: 当前拖拽编辑方法因仅匹配用户定义点而忽略整体几何，导致编辑结果不稳定或产生伪影。

Method: FlowDrag构建图像的3D网格，利用能量函数指导基于用户拖拽点的网格变形，并将位移投影到2D，结合UNet去噪过程实现精确编辑。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD Bench和DragBench上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过几何信息提升了拖拽编辑的准确性和一致性，同时VFD数据集为评估提供了真实标注。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在捕捉相机-物体关系（如物体方向、相机视角和镜头）方面表现不佳，主要因为训练数据缺乏多样性。

Method: 利用3D资产、渲染和扩散模型生成逼真图像，结合大语言模型（LLMs）生成文本提示，构建240K的VQA数据集Ultimate3D。

Result: 在相机-物体关系识别任务中，基于Ultimate3D微调的MLLMs平均准确率提升33.4%，显著优于商业模型。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和框架为MLLMs的广泛应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.
