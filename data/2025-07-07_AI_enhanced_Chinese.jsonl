Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone.

An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIRES\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fGCN\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3001GDS\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e861.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Submitted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline\ncandidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and\nalgorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively).

Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth.

AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several\nrehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,\nmaintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as\na scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary\ncontinual learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAMR\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u517c\u987e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u8fc7\u65f6\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u65b0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "AMR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "AMR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u3002"}}

While expert demonstrations seem like a\nnatural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.\nInstead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they\nshould (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's\nlikelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we\npropose $\\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and\nmodular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the\nground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to\nproduce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written\nCoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.\nExperiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final\nperformance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based\nmethods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially\nstruggles the most.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aExPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "ExPO\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728MATH level-5\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ExPO\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes.

We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions.

Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy\nprotocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology\nand/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model\nweights.

At\ntraining time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on\nwell-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.\nHowever, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual\ndescriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are\nincomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,\nwe make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data\navailable during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates\nof treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text\nconfounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time\nbut only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address\nthis problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects\nthat explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding.
