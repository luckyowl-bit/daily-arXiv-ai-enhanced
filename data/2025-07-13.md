### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多级专家混合模型（MMoE）来解决多模态实体链接中的提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，限制了多模态实体链接的性能。

Method: MMoE包含四个模块：描述感知提及增强模块、多模态特征提取模块、以及两个专家混合模块，用于动态选择特征。

Result: 实验表明MMoE在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择特征和多模态交互，显著提升了多模态实体链接的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无监督域自适应（UDA）方法CoPT，利用文本嵌入学习域不变特征，在语义分割任务中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割的标注成本高，现有UDA方法未充分利用文本的域无关特性。

Method: 提出基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），结合LLM生成的域描述和CLIP模型学习域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CoPT达到了UDA分割任务的最新性能。

Conclusion: CoPT通过文本嵌入有效提升了UDA分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Recall的对抗框架，旨在测试图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）在机器遗忘（MU）技术下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成模型能力的提升，其潜在的伦理、法律和社会问题日益突出，机器遗忘技术被提出以解决这些问题。然而，现有遗忘技术的鲁棒性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: Recall通过优化对抗性图像提示，利用扩散模型的多模态条件能力，测试现有遗忘方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上均优于现有基线方法，揭示了当前遗忘机制的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的遗忘解决方案的必要性，以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了可解释人工智能（XAI）在生物医学图像分析中的应用，填补了现有研究中缺乏模态感知视角、忽视多模态和视觉语言模型进展的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进深度学习模型在生物医学图像分析中的透明性、信任度和临床采用率。

Result: 提供了XAI方法的详细分析、评估指标和开源框架，并讨论了挑战与未来方向。

Conclusion: 为生物医学图像分析中的可解释深度学习提供了全面且及时的基础。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉现象，提出模态冲突是导致幻觉的原因，并构建了MMMC数据集。通过三种方法（提示工程、监督微调和强化学习）缓解幻觉，实验表明强化学习效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在真实场景中产生幻觉的原因，特别是模态冲突对模型的影响。

Method: 定义模态冲突并构建MMMC数据集，提出基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的三种方法。

Result: 强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉中表现最佳，监督微调方法表现稳定。

Conclusion: 揭示了模态冲突对MLLMs幻觉的影响，为模型鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在GNSS不可用环境下，利用YOLOv8模型和特征匹配技术实现自主海上监视和目标船只识别的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的环境中，自主识别目标船只对搜索救援和威胁检测等应用至关重要。

Method: 结合YOLOv8目标检测模型、特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析，通过几何原理定位目标船只。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中进行了真实环境测试，验证了方法的有效性，并评估了视角对检测和定位精度的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在GNSS不可用环境下能有效识别和定位目标船只，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp是一种基于对比学习的息肉分割网络，通过自监督策略和多尺度特征融合模块，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖额外标注数据和任务相似性，限制了泛化能力，因此提出CL-Polyp以解决这些问题。

Method: 采用对比学习增强编码器特征提取能力，并引入MASPP和CA模块优化多尺度特征融合与边界重建。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU指标在Kvasir-SEG和CVC-ClinicDB上分别提升0.011和0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp在临床息肉分割任务中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

### [8] [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157)
*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过EEG信号与多级语义描述对齐的方法，绕过直接图像生成，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型实现视觉解码，取得了EEGCVPR数据集上的先进成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号在空间细节上的局限性阻碍了图像重建，但通过语义中介可以更好地解码视觉体验。

Method: 使用基于transformer的EEG编码器将脑活动映射到多级语义描述，通过对比学习训练，并利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码，揭示了EEG信号与语义描述的显著关联。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的语义中介，能够实现与认知对齐的EEG视觉解码。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: 论文分析了现有视频生成模型在生成长视频（超过16秒）时的问题，如角色一致性和场景布局的保持困难，并提出了一种新的分类法和比较表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型在生成长视频时无法保持角色一致性和场景布局的问题，以及多主题长视频中角色一致性和运动连贯性的挑战。

Method: 综合研究了32篇视频生成论文，识别关键架构组件和训练策略，并构建了新的分类法和比较表。

Result: 提出了一个全面的分类法，将现有方法按架构设计和性能特征分类，并总结了能生成高质量长视频的关键策略。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析，论文为未来视频生成模型的设计提供了指导，特别是在长视频生成的角色一致性和场景布局方面。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSCI的轻量级方法，利用颜色信息解决衣物变化重识别问题，无需额外标注或模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物变化重识别（CC-ReID）通常依赖额外模型或标注，资源消耗大。作者探索颜色作为轻量级替代方案。

Method: 提出CSCI方法，利用RGB信息分离颜色相关偏差与身份特征，引入S2A自注意力防止信息泄露。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上显著提升性能，图像和视频重识别分别提高2.9%-5.0%和1.0%-2.5%。

Conclusion: 颜色是解决CC-ReID中外观偏差的高效低成本方案。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VFX制作中掩码生成缓慢且资源密集的问题。

Method: 结合机器学习，通过文本提示进行灵活对象检测、逐帧图像分割和鲁棒视频跟踪。

Result: 减少了人工操作，加快了初步合成的速度，并提供了全面的分割数据。

Conclusion: 该流程显著提升了VFX制作的效率，并得到了艺术家的快速采用。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，用于解决活动生物识别中的身份特征与运动和外观变化的纠缠问题，并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统身份识别在多样化活动中面临身份特征与运动动态和外观变化纠缠的挑战，现有视觉数据方法因提取不准确而受限。

Method: 提出DisenQ框架，利用结构化文本指导解耦生物特征、运动和非生物特征，避免依赖额外视觉数据。

Result: 在三个活动视频基准测试中达到最优性能，并在传统视频识别任务中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架通过语言指导有效解耦特征，显著提升了活动生物识别的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

*Ananya Raval,Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark是一个多语言视觉问答（VQA）基准，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）的多语言能力，揭示闭源模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在语言覆盖上存在偏差和不公平输出，缺乏对多语言能力的评估。

Method: 构建包含6,875对图像-文本数据的LinguaMark基准，覆盖11种语言和5种社会属性，评估指标包括偏差、答案相关性和忠实度。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）表现最佳，开源模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在特定语言上表现优异。

Conclusion: LinguaMark为多语言LMMs评估提供了工具，开源模型在多语言泛化上具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagiC是一个评估多模态认知的基准，旨在测试模型是否真正进行视觉推理，而非依赖数据偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答和多模态推理中表现优异，但其是否真正进行视觉推理尚不明确。

Method: MagiC包含5500个弱监督QA示例和900个人工标注示例，评估15个模型在答案正确性、推理有效性、视觉证据对齐和自我纠正能力四个维度。

Result: 研究揭示了当前视觉推理方法的关键局限和机会，并提出了新指标MagiScore和StepSense。

Conclusion: MagiC为评估和改进多模态认知模型提供了重要工具和分析框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

### [15] [ADIEE: Automatic Dataset Creation and Scorer for Instruction-Guided Image Editing Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07317)
*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化数据集创建方法ADIEE，用于训练评分模型以评估指令引导的图像编辑效果，显著优于现有开源和专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在指令引导图像编辑的自动评估中存在对齐问题、透明度和成本效率不足，且缺乏公开训练数据集。

Method: 通过ADIEE生成大规模数据集（超10万样本），并微调LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型以解码自定义标记的数值分数。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中表现最佳，与人类评分的相关性提升17.24%，比较准确率最高提升9.35%。

Conclusion: 该评分模型可作为奖励模型，显著提升现有模型的评估分数，如MagicBrush在ImagenHub上的得分提升8.98%。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the

propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉叙事系统在跨帧识别角色和对象身份时表现不佳，导致引用不一致和幻觉问题，原因是缺乏明确的跨帧实体连接训练。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展Story Reasoning数据集并引入合成负例，使用Direct Preference Optimization和双组分奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 模型在多个指标上显著提升，包括grounding mAP（+14.8%）、F1（+17.1%）和跨帧实体持久性（+13.7%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统的实体识别和一致性，显著改善了故事结构和连贯性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Conclusion: PacGDC通过伪几何合成和数据多样性增强，显著提升了深度补全的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

Motivation: 现有PSM方法无法自动调整粒子配置以适应局部几何特征，限制了复杂解剖变异的准确表示。

Result: 在复杂数据集上验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，分析了适应性与对应性的权衡，并在表面表示和对应指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的机制显著提高了PSM的自适应性，为复杂解剖变异的量化提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Result: 在五个PES基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: MSAGSM轻量且高效，为PES领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动转移方法主要关注人类运动，忽略了动物特有的习惯行为，需要一种能保留这些行为的方法。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D-skl数据集上的实验验证了模型在保留习惯行为方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了跨类别动物运动转移，同时保留了物种特有的习惯行为。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Result: 实验表明，Seg-Wild在分割效果和重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景的分割和重建提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Method: 通过输入级和特征级掩码微调，实现端到端模型，提升新视角合成和模态补全能力。

Result: 在遮挡任务中，PSNR提升3.9，Volume IoU提升0.28，重建时间减少95%。

Conclusion: EscherNet++在较小数据集和批量下实现SOTA结果，并适用于真实世界遮挡重建。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Conclusion: EPIC是一种高效的多模态交互策略，显著降低计算成本并保持高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and

limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks

(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality

diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its

demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

TL;DR: Objectomaly是一种基于对象感知的OoD分割框架，通过对象级先验改进边界精度和异常评分一致性，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于掩码的OoD分割方法在边界精度、异常评分一致性和背景噪声方面的不足。

Method: 分为三个阶段：粗粒度异常评分（CAS）、对象感知评分校准（OASC）和精细边界处理（MBP）。

Result: 在SMIYC和RoadAnomaly等基准测试中达到最优性能，显著提升像素级和组件级指标。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象级先验和边界优化，显著提升了OoD分割的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的盲人脸图像恢复框架，通过局部统计面部特征变换（SFFT）和退化无关特征嵌入（DAFE）模块，显著提升了恶劣天气条件下的面部恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的人脸识别系统性能下降，现有基于GAN和扩散模型的恢复方法因缺乏针对性模块而效果有限。

Method: 结合局部SFFT模块和DAFE模块，前者优化面部结构和颜色保真度，后者实现退化无关的特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和准确重建面部结构方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块有效提升了恶劣天气下的人脸恢复质量。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成时间不可学习示例（TUEs）的新框架，用于保护视频数据隐私，防止未经授权的深度跟踪器利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，大量用户上传的视频被用于视觉目标跟踪（VOT）训练，但数据隐私问题被忽视，许多私人视频未经授权被用于商业模型训练。

Method: 提出了一种生成时间不可学习示例（TUEs）的生成框架，并引入时间对比损失以增强效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面达到了最先进的性能，并具有强大的跨模型、跨数据集和跨任务的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视频数据隐私保护问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为自动驾驶车辆的混合导航提供了新的基准和方法，增强了规划能力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Method: 提出DMPO方法，通过最小化反向KL散度对齐扩散模型。

Result: DMPO在人类评估和自动指标上均优于现有技术，PickScore提升至少64.6%。

Conclusion: DMPO为扩散模型偏好对齐提供了稳健且优雅的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人体姿态表示为抽象图结构，忽略了关节间的物理依赖性，导致学习困难且易生成不真实的运动。GGMotion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分组图网络，提出径向场以捕捉时空依赖性，结合组内和组间交互模块及等变多层感知机，通过并行化动力学-运动学传播更新关节特征。

Result: 在Human3.6M、CMU-Mocap和3DPW三个基准测试中表现优异，短期运动预测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过建模物理依赖性和引入辅助损失，有效提升了运动预测的物理合理性和准确性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Result: MUVOD数据集支持多视角视频分割和3D对象分割任务，为研究提供了基准。

Conclusion: MUVOD填补了动态场景分割数据集的空白，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Conclusion: 样条轨迹表示方法在保持空间一致性和时间插值性能上优于现有方法，无需依赖线性混合蒙皮或刚性约束。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Conclusion: MAPEX通过多模态专家混合和模态感知剪枝，有效解决了模态不匹配问题，提升了任务适应性和效率。

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Method: 引入LSC作为衡量指标，通过线性分类器评估VLMs视觉嵌入的性能，并采用后置调优（postfix tuning）作为方法控制。

Result: 发现VLMs中存在强大的休眠推理路径，但复杂关系推理需要更深层次的权重调整；改进表示质量可能导致新提示格式的失败。

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健推理的关键在于针对性对齐，而非单纯改进表示学习，为VLM分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Result: 实验证明DGKD-WLSS在低光条件下的弱监督语义分割任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS有效解决了低光环境下弱监督语义分割的挑战，并显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Motivation: 洪水造成重大社会经济损失，现有方法在覆盖范围和空间细节上存在不足，需要更高效的3D洪水测绘方法。

Method: HOTA通过多尺度重叠瓦片处理Sentinel-2图像，结合SegFormer和DEM差分方法，估计洪水深度。

Result: 在Kempsey洪水案例中，IoU从73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米。

Conclusion: HOTA能生成高精度、大范围的3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的开放词汇分割在激光雷达扫描中的应用，解决传统方法中标签噪声和稀疏性问题。

Method: 通过整合标签以增强时空一致性和对图像级增强的鲁棒性，并基于这些标签训练3D网络。

Conclusion: LOSC是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了激光雷达扫描的语义和全景分割性能。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了包含12个任务、1,180个自动生成问题的多模态基准测试SpatialViz-Bench，评估了33个先进MLLM。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在反直觉行为（如感知困难、2D到3D性能骤降、依赖公式推导而非可视化）。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench填补了空间可视化评估的空白，显示先进MLLM仍有不足，基准已公开。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Conclusion: ViLU在不确定性量化方面表现优异，架构和训练方法至关重要。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Motivation: 现有生成视频编码方法受限于领域特异性或过度依赖高级文本引导，导致运动细节丢失和重建不真实。

Method: T-GVC采用语义感知稀疏运动采样，结合轨迹对齐损失约束，实现低码率下的高效视频编码。

Result: 实验表明，T-GVC在超低码率下优于传统编解码器和端到端压缩方法，并实现更精确的运动控制。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Result: 模型在老年人群体中的识别准确性显著提升，尤其是易错表情，且注意力区域更相关。

Conclusion: 通过简单训练修改可有效缓解年龄偏见，近似人口统计标签对促进大规模情感计算系统的公平性有价值。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Result: 在MitoDataset上，药物识别和MoA识别的mAP分别提升51.2%和20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态融合显著提升了药物作用机制识别的性能。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Result: 实验表明，RED在多个基准测试和LVLM中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED为提升多模态CoT推理的准确性和可靠性提供了一种实用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Result: 在局部和全局模糊数据集上表现优于现有方法，计算量减少49%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，为局部运动模糊去除提供了新思路。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

Result: 实验表明，CRAFT在跨任务攻击和目标对象改变成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CrossVLAD和CRAFT为评估和攻击统一VLMs提供了有效工具，揭示了其安全漏洞。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的2D架构无法直接应用于3D医学影像（如CT或MRI），现有3D方法通常复杂且计算资源密集。

Method: 受SegVol启发，设计了一种简化的3D可提示分割方法，避免滑动窗口等复杂策略。

Result: 实现了高性能，同时显著减少了推理时间和复杂性。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D医学影像分割提供了一种高效且简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于能量的解码方法，减少大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，显著提高了准确性和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在解码方式、视觉输入修改或依赖外部模型知识方面的局限性。

Method: 动态选择能量分数最低的隐藏状态层，减少对“是”回答的偏见。

Result: 在三个基准测试中平均准确率提升4.82%，平均“是”比例差距减少8.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，减少了偏见并提升了性能。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

TL;DR: 提出了一个全栈框架，通过强化学习扩展视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长视频中的推理能力，包括数据集、训练流程和基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的独特挑战，提升视觉语言模型在长视频中的表现。

Method: 整合大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason、两阶段训练流程（CoT-SFT和RL）和MR-SP基础设施。

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B在长视频QA基准测试中表现优异，MR-SP系统实现2.1倍加速。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1为长视频推理迈出重要一步，并公开支持多模态RL训练的系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件的高速率双流脉冲神经网络（SNN），用于早期人类活动识别，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别人类活动对安全和人机交互至关重要，事件视觉传感器因其高时间分辨率和低延迟成为理想选择，但现有方法限制了早期预测能力。

Method: 采用高速率双流SNN处理事件数据，并在THU EACT-50数据集上测试。

Result: 在最终准确率上优于之前工作2%，并在早期识别框架中报告了Top-1和Top-5得分。

Conclusion: 该方法在体育动作捕捉等实际任务中展现了早期触发的潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面评估视觉基础推理能力的基准测试，TreeBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于三个原则构建TreeBench：聚焦视觉感知、可追溯证据和二阶推理。通过专家标注和严格质量控制生成数据集。提出TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习监督定位和推理。

Result: 现有模型在TreeBench上表现不佳（最高准确率低于60%），TreeVGR显著提升了多个基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 可追溯性是提升视觉基础推理的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预训练模型的最终层特征，限制了其在新领域的适应性，而全微调又往往不切实际。稀疏-密集侧调谐器（SDST）旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了SDST架构，结合参考可变形自注意力机制，改进了现有锚点无关方法的上下文建模能力，并首次将InternVideo2骨干网络集成到侧调谐框架中。

Result: 在QVHighlights、TACoS和Charades-STA数据集上取得了竞争性或SOTA结果，同时参数数量减少了73%。

Conclusion: SDST方法显著提升了现有侧调谐方法的性能，同时大幅减少了参数数量，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Motivation: 将高光谱成像技术整合到荧光引导神经手术中，以实时提供定量荧光测量，从而改善手术决策。

Method: 引入X-RAFT模型，改进RAFT光流模型以处理跨模态输入，使用自监督学习优化模态特定的图像编码器。

Result: X-RAFT在评估指标上比基线方法减少36.6%误差，比现有跨模态光流方法（CrossRAFT）减少27.83%误差。

Conclusion: X-RAFT在跨模态高光谱图像对应任务中表现出色，为荧光定量测量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Motivation: 增材制造中的几何误差会影响零件性能，传统DVC方法因缺乏参考变形场和大数据量而难以精确配准。

Method: 采用动态分块处理的深度学习策略，并引入二元差异图（BDM）量化配准精度。

Result: 相比传统方法，Dice Score提升9.2%，体素匹配率提升9.9%，交互时间从数天缩短至分钟级。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于深度学习的DVC技术奠定了基础，有望提升增材制造的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御策略无法应对无限制对抗攻击，且缺乏统计显著的人类评估方法，因此需要统一框架。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括最佳实践指南、大规模人类评估、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 发现三种颜色空间攻击和三种扩散攻击无法生成不可感知图像，GPT-4o仅能检测部分攻击。

Conclusion: 自动化视觉系统与人类感知不一致，需SCOOTER基准作为真实标准。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Motivation: 探讨在数据集偏移下如何选择最佳校准方法，为实践者提供稳健校准的指导。

Method: 比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），在多个分类任务和图像领域中进行实验。

Result: 发现熵正则化和标签平滑结合效果最佳，后处理校准方法在少量OOD数据下表现稳健，新校准方法未必优于简单方法，且校准改进可能牺牲分布内性能。

Conclusion: 基础模型微调优于从头训练，集成方法结合微调能提供最佳校准效果。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优（VPT）使用固定数据集级提示，导致性能不佳，因为下游数据集的方差较高。

Method: 提出ViaPT，为每个输入生成实例感知提示，并与数据集级提示融合，使用PCA保留重要信息。

Result: 在34个数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT通过平衡数据集级和实例级知识，为视觉变换器的提示优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

### [73] [Patient-specific vs Multi-Patient Vision Transformer for Markerless Tumor Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07811)
*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViT）的无标记肺肿瘤运动预测方法，比较了患者特异性（PS）和多患者（MP）训练策略，发现PS模型在精度上更优，而MP模型在临床时间受限的情况下更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无标记方法多依赖深度学习，但基于Transformer的架构在轨迹预测中表现优异却未在此领域探索。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT扫描生成的DRR训练MP模型，PS模型仅使用目标患者的规划数据。两种模型均预测1秒内的肿瘤运动，并通过ADE和FDE评估性能。

Result: PS模型在规划数据上表现更优，但MP模型对分次间解剖变化更具鲁棒性，且在治疗数据上表现相当。

Conclusion: ViT首次应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测，PS模型精度高，MP模型适合临床时间受限的场景。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有拼图求解器在真实场景（如文物或文档碎片重组）中缺乏对实际挑战的评估。

Method: 引入三种拼图损坏类型，评估启发式和深度学习求解器的表现，并分析其局限性。

Result: 标准拼图求解器在损坏增加时性能迅速下降，但深度学习模型通过微调可显著提升鲁棒性，其中Positional Diffusion模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升真实场景拼图求解器的鲁棒性提供了方向。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有解耦框架在CIS中导致的塑性损失和输入顺序依赖问题。

Method: 直接选择图像特征进行查询分配，确保完美对齐，并引入跨阶段一致性和视觉查询重放机制。

Result: SimCIS在多种分割任务、设置和输入顺序中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SimCIS是一个简单而强大的CIS基线，有效解决了遗忘和塑性问题。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中表面缺陷检测对提高良率至关重要，但现有数据集难以反映真实工业场景，限制了检测方法的改进。

Method: 构建了3D-ADAM数据集，包含14,120个高分辨率扫描样本和27,346个标注缺陷实例，覆盖12类工业表面缺陷。

Result: 评估显示现有SOTA模型在3D-ADAM上表现不佳，验证了数据集的挑战性和工业相关性。

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为开发鲁棒的3D异常检测模型提供了重要基准，有望推动工业检测技术的发展。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: THUNDER为数字病理学领域提供了高效的模型比较工具，有助于推动研究进展。

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的水下图像恢复方法在复杂场景中效果不佳且计算量大，需要改进。

Method: 结合预训练的潜在扩散模型和显式场景分解，并设计物理基础的水下图像合成管道生成训练数据。

Result: SLURPP比现有方法快200倍，在合成基准上PSNR提升约3 dB，并在真实数据上表现优异。

Conclusion: SLURPP在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂水下场景的图像恢复。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医疗诊断中常生成与医学知识不符的响应，检索增强生成虽能提升准确性，但存在检索不足或过度的问题。

Method: MIRA框架包含动态调整检索上下文的模块和整合图像嵌入与医学知识库的多模态检索增强生成框架。

Result: 在公开医疗VQA和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA显著提升了事实准确性和性能，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: MIRA通过优化检索和整合多模态数据，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在医疗诊断中的事实不一致问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Motivation: 现代导航系统（如自动驾驶车辆、无人机等）需要精确的位置估计，而VSLAM依赖可靠的特征点提取。现有方法计算需求高，难以在资源有限平台上高效部署。

Method: 采用量化SuperPoint CNN架构，结合Brevitas库和FINN框架进行模型量化和硬件优化，在AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA平台上实现。

Result: 在FPGA平台上以54 fps处理640x480像素图像，性能优于现有方案。通过TUM数据集验证了量化技术对模型精度和性能的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持高检测质量的同时显著降低了计算需求，适用于资源受限的嵌入式系统。

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG模型在未见过部署环境中的适应性受限，隐私和实时性要求限制了其实际应用，因此需要一种无需源数据的实时自适应方法。

Method: 基于生理学先验知识，提出CiCi框架，结合时空一致性和不一致性，并引入梯度动态控制机制以避免先验冲突。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的TTA实验中，CiCi方法表现优于现有技术，实现了无需源数据的实时自适应。

Conclusion: CiCi框架在rPPG任务中表现出色，为实时自监督自适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing有效提升了视频扩散模型的几何感知能力，使其更符合3D物理世界的特性。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中学习绑定能力的局限性，发现数据属性（如低属性密度、不完整标注和显著性偏差）是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在绑定能力上存在明显缺陷，例如无法区分颜色和物体的组合。作者怀疑问题的根源在于数据属性，而非训练方法或架构。

Method: 使用合成数据集系统分析数据属性对CLIP绑定能力的影响，包括属性密度、标注完整性和显著性偏差。

Result: 研究发现，数据属性（如高属性密度和完整标注）是CLIP学习可靠绑定的关键，而增加负样本或批量大小无效。

Conclusion: 仅当数据满足特定属性时，CLIP才能实现近乎完美的绑定能力，这为改进模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的时空令牌合并方法STTM，通过利用视频数据中的局部时空冗余，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型（LLMs）在处理大量时空令牌时存在计算复杂度二次增长的问题，而现有方法未充分利用局部冗余。

Method: STTM通过四叉树结构的粗到细搜索将每帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中表现优异，50%令牌预算下实现2倍加速且精度仅下降0.5%，30%预算下3倍加速且精度下降2%。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效且查询无关的令牌合并方法，支持KV缓存重用，显著提升视频理解效率。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估协议依赖粗粒度指标，掩盖模型差异，缺乏神经科学基础，无法捕捉细粒度视觉差异。

Method: 引入BASIC框架，包括基于分割的分层指标和多模态大语言模型提取的语义场景表示。

Result: 在统一框架下对多种视觉解码方法进行基准测试，提供更区分性和解释性的评估。

Conclusion: BASIC为脑视觉解码方法提供了更全面和科学的评估基础。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用草图进行少样本关键点检测的框架，解决了跨模态嵌入和用户特定草图风格的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本学习中源数据与查询数据分布不一致的问题，利用草图作为无源替代方案。

Method: 采用原型设置、基于网格的定位器和原型域适应方法。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了在新关键点和类别上的少样本收敛成功。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了草图驱动的少样本关键点检测问题。

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种单次自适应分词器KARL，基于Kolmogorov复杂性原则，预测图像的分词数量，并在单次前向传播中完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉表示学习系统使用固定长度表示，忽略了输入数据的复杂性或熟悉度变化。KARL旨在通过自适应分词解决这一问题。

Method: KARL采用单次前向传播预测分词数量，训练过程类似于倒置强化学习，根据重建质量预测分词停止。

Result: KARL性能与现有自适应分词器相当，但只需单次操作。论文还分析了编码器/解码器大小、连续与离散分词等因素的缩放规律。

Conclusion: KARL在自适应图像分词与算法信息理论之间建立了联系，揭示了图像复杂性与人类直觉的一致性。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQ-VAEs在重建质量上与VAEs存在较大差距，作者希望通过改进量化策略缩小这一差距。

Method: 保留潜在维度以保留编码特征，并引入一组子码本进行量化。

Result: 在ImageNet和8个零样本基准测试中取得最佳性能，显著优于SD-VAE（rFID 0.49 vs. 0.91）。

Conclusion: \NickName在重建任务中表现出色，为高清图像处理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD

TL;DR: 研究探讨了CLIP和大型多模态模型（LMMs）中概念组合对性能的影响，发现词共现统计（PMI）与模型准确性高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究训练数据中概念组合对组合泛化的影响，特别是常见物体与不常见配对时的准确性变化。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）衡量词共现频率，通过合成图像和自然图像编辑验证PMI与模型准确性的相关性。

Result: PMI与CLIP模型的零样本准确性高度相关（r=0.97），且在自然图像中重现（r=0.75），此效应也延伸至LMMs（r=0.70-0.62）。

Conclusion: 需开发算法和架构以改进多模态模型的组合泛化能力，而非单纯扩展训练数据。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见主要源于预训练阶段，而非微调或训练随机性。通过交叉调优实验，揭示了预训练对偏见模式的决定性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中认知偏见的来源，区分预训练、微调和训练随机性对偏见的影响。

Method: 采用两步因果实验：1）多次微调模型以研究训练随机性对30多种认知偏见的影响；2）交叉调优（交换指令数据集）以隔离偏见来源。

Result: 训练随机性引入一定变异性，但偏见模式主要由预训练决定；相同预训练模型的偏见模式更相似。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏见需考虑预训练起源，为未来评估和减轻LLM偏见提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

Motivation: 评估LLMs作为人类受试者代理的可靠性及其对已知响应偏差的敏感性。

Method: 测试了九种不同的LLMs，对世界价值观调查（WVS）问题应用了11种扰动，模拟了超过167,000次访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出不同程度的近因偏差，且对语义变化和组合扰动敏感。较大模型更稳健，但仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs生成合成调查数据时，提示设计和鲁棒性测试至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估，SynthTextEval提升了合成文本的可行性，促进了AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

Result: 通过案例研究（MediPhi模型）验证了评估协议的有效性，首次从患者、临床医生和普通用户三个视角定义了安全标准。

Conclusion: 为医疗领域LLMs的安全部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在多组对话中考虑重叠语音影响的打断检测奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive

readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction是一个结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化的管道，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公开驱逐相关SDoH数据集，性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的重要社会决定因素，但研究不足，且在电子健康记录中缺乏结构化编码，限制了应用。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）构建SynthEHR-Eviction管道，提取临床记录中的驱逐状态。

Result: 创建的SDoH数据集包含14个细粒度类别，微调LLMs性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT，标注工作量减少80%。

Conclusion: 该管道高效、可扩展，适用于驱逐检测及其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: 压缩时间序列理解到轻量级语言模型是可行的，为开发小型可解释模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理调优方法可能因动作空间探索不足而选择次优动作，需改进。

Method: 采用自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作批评，合成动作审议轨迹并迭代调优。

Result: 在两个交互代理任务中，SAND平均提升20%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAND框架通过动作审议显著提升LLM代理性能，为调优提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Method: 两阶段框架：先收集已验证轨迹，再在训练中重放这些轨迹，结合新生成的数据进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升准确率，如AIME-2024从38.2%提升至39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量经验，有效提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM中真实性丧失的广泛现象，揭示其机制，为更真实的LLM行为提供新见解。

Method: 提出“废话指数”和四种废话分类（空话、模糊措辞、推诿词、未经证实的说法），并在多个数据集（Marketplace、Political Neutrality、BullshitEval）上进行实证评估。

Result: RLHF微调和CoT提示显著加剧废话行为，政治语境中推诿词占主导。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为改进LLM的真实性提供了方向。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Motivation: 探索如何利用任务分解（规划轨迹）提升小语言模型的性能，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 提出PLAN-TUNING框架，包括从大模型蒸馏规划轨迹，并通过监督和强化学习微调小模型。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准上平均提升7%，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是一种有效提升小模型复杂推理能力的策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，但现有方法因依赖复杂代码结构易导致过拟合，需改进。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，引导模型在代码任务中发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在17个基准测试中，TeaR显著提升性能，如Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升LLM推理能力，尤其在代码相关任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORR催化剂对提升燃料电池效率至关重要，但现有文献数据复杂多样，难以高效提取结构化信息。

Method: 采用DyGIE++框架，结合MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT等预训练模型，进行数据标注、整合和模型微调，以提升信息提取准确性。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1-score达82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中F1-score达66.10%，优于通用科学模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取中表现更优，展示了自动化文献分析的潜力。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Result: 研究表明，LLMs无法执行或验证超出特定复杂度的计算和代理任务。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LLMs的能力边界，对其实用性提出了重要限制。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Result: CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上的策略预测和情感支持对话任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和系统有效解决了心理支持数据稀缺问题，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在少样本提示下的表现，尤其是在噪声或低质量数据环境中，是否能够超越传统微调的小语言模型（SLMs）。

Method: 方法包括使用精心设计的少样本提示，并尝试了高级提示工程技术（如LLMs辩论和多样本选择策略），但发现标准少样本提示效果最佳。

Result: 系统在CheckThat! 2025任务中表现优异，尤其在阿拉伯语和波兰语中排名第一，其他语言中也名列前茅，展示了LLMs的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 结论是LLM少样本学习在多语言情感任务中高效且适应性强，为传统微调提供了有力替代方案，尤其在标注数据稀缺或不一致时。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Result: 研究发现检索是跨语言场景的主要瓶颈，性能下降显著。提出的策略显著提升了跨语言和整体性能。

Conclusion: 改进多语言检索在现实RAG应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探讨SFT和RL在VLM中的联合有效性及其对多模态推理的影响。

Method: 通过多种训练策略（如两阶段、交替或渐进训练）和数据混合、模型合并等方法，评估SFT和RL的效果。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题的推理能力但降低简单问题性能；RL提升泛化性和简洁性，但两者结合未实现叠加效果。

Conclusion: 需开发更自适应的方法以充分发挥SFT和RL在VLM中的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within

and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment

DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示离散扩散语言模型的贝叶斯性质，并利用这一性质改进模型性能。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛边缘化对K个独立损坏进行平均，提出推理时集成方法。

Result: 在WikiText-2上，测试困惑度为8.8（K=8），优于GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练成本即可提升性能，并提供了后验感知的概率和不确定性估计。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

TL;DR: LLMs通过知识蒸馏压缩，在QA任务中保持90%性能，参数减少57.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在资源受限环境中的部署问题。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏压缩Pythia和Qwen2.5模型，在SQuAD和MLQA基准上评估零样本和单样本提示。

Result: 学生模型性能保留90%以上，参数减少57.1%；单样本提示优于零样本。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可实现高效且性能良好的QA系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，强调无需大规模微调即可提升性能，并通过监督和RL微调优化检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂问答问题时，现有方法过于依赖大规模微调和多次检索，忽略了检索效率的重要性。

Method: 采用标准ReAct流程和改进的提示，结合监督和RL微调，以减少检索次数并保持性能。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，且检索成本降低近一半。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高效RAG可通过小规模训练和优化检索策略实现，无需依赖大规模微调。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Motivation: 语音伪装替换（PCR）成为中文内容审核的主要障碍，现有方法依赖规则生成的合成数据，忽略了真实用户的创造性。

Method: 提出PCR的四类分类法，构建真实数据集RedNote，评估现有LLM模型，并改进拼音提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型F1分数仅为0.672，改进的拼音提示策略显著提升了检测准确率。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类了中文PCR，揭示了当前检测器的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级改进方法。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 传统摘要评估依赖耗时的人工参考摘要，NOIR旨在提供自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，量化语义保留与压缩长度的权衡。

Result: 实验表明NOIR能有效捕捉摘要器的语义保留与长度压缩关系，并与人类感知一致。

Conclusion: NOIR为摘要任务提供自动化评估工具，适用于改进摘要算法、提示和生成摘要。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到多头注意力（MHA）性能随注意力头数量增加而提升，但需保持每个头的隐藏尺寸足够大。因此，如何在最小参数开销下增加头和隐藏尺寸成为研究动机。

Method: 引入SAS，通过将低维头表示投影到高维空间，模拟更多头和更大特征维度，同时提出参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）控制参数成本。

Result: 在多种数据集和任务上的实验表明，SAS方法显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法在保持模型紧凑的同时，通过模拟更大模型的行为显著提升了性能，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLMs）微调过程中资源消耗高的问题，以及传统RAG实现的可扩展性和答案准确性不足的挑战。

Method: K2RAG结合了密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要技术，并引入预处理步骤对训练数据进行摘要，以减少训练时间。

Result: 在MultiHopRAG数据集上，K2RAG实现了最高的平均答案相似度得分（0.57）和第三四分位数相似度（0.82），训练时间减少93%，执行速度提高40%，且VRAM需求减少三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面均优于传统RAG实现，为知识扩展提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

TL;DR: 论文验证了Vec2Text框架的有效性，发现其能从嵌入中重建原始文本，但存在局限性，并提出量化等防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为传输文本嵌入是隐私保护的，但Vec2Text挑战了这一假设，因此需要进一步验证其效果和局限性。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架，验证其原始结论，并通过参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重建和嵌入量化实验扩展研究。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下有效，能重建密码等敏感信息，但对输入长度敏感；高斯噪声和量化可降低隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用文本嵌入，并进一步研究NLP系统的防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，Selective-DPO优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对LLM偏好对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的分类法，为研究人员提供技术路线图，为从业者提供概念框架，奠定法律人工智能的坚实基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Motivation: 现有流式语音翻译方法依赖句子级语音分段（SimulST），受限于分段模型的协作，策略决策和翻译生成基于有限上下文信息，且难以学习有效策略。

Method: 提出StreamUni，利用LSLM和语音CoT生成多阶段输出，实现语音分段、策略决策和翻译生成的统一；并提出流式CoT训练方法，提升低延迟策略决策和生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型和多阶段输出解决了现有方法的局限性，无需大量策略训练即可高效完成流式语音翻译。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识整合到数据驱动学习算法中需要语义一致的连续表示，并且这些表示必须可逆以生成具体逻辑要求。

Method: 训练一个Transformer解码器模型，通过STL语法构建的小词汇表，反转语义嵌入并生成有效的STL公式。

Result: 模型在1个epoch后即可生成有效公式，10个epoch后能泛化逻辑语义，并能生成更简单但语义相近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种复杂度训练数据中表现良好，并成功应用于需求挖掘任务，直接在语义空间中进行优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Motivation: 传统指令微调中，损失函数仅计算响应标记而忽略提示标记，这可能不是最优选择。本文旨在探索优化损失函数对指令微调性能的影响。

Method: 提出Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT)，对提示和响应标记进行差异化加权，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，传统指令微调损失函数性能次优且对输入提示变化的鲁棒性有限，而WIT在多种模型和数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: WIT是一种更优的指令微调方法，为后续偏好对齐训练提供了更好的起点，强调了重新考虑损失函数的必要性。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进传统单字分词方法，使其能更好地适应跨语言任务，如机器翻译和语言建模。

Method: 利用并行数据，固定源语言分词器，学习目标语言分词器以最大化语义对齐。

Result: 在机器翻译中无显著改进，但在语言建模中困惑度持续降低。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次方扩展可能导致数据效率瓶颈，需探索其他参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了实体共指对RAG框架中检索和生成性能的影响，发现共指消解能提升检索效果和QA性能，小模型受益更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG框架在NLP中表现优异，但共指复杂性会引入歧义，影响性能。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过比较不同池化策略和共指消解方法，分析其对检索和QA任务的影响。

Result: 共指消解提升检索效果；均值池化在共指消解后表现最佳；小模型在消歧过程中受益更多。

Conclusion: 研究为RAG中核心指复杂性的挑战提供了解决方案，有助于提升知识密集型AI应用的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Alpay Algebra的自引用框架，提出了一种多层语义游戏架构，通过超限固定点收敛实现分层子游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Alpay Algebra IV的同理嵌入概念，研究AI系统与文档对齐过程中的嵌套博弈结构。

Method: 引入复合算子ϕ(⋅,γ(⋅))，ϕ驱动主语义收敛，γ解决局部子游戏，并验证了博弈定理的存在性和唯一性。

Result: 证明了在现实认知模拟假设下语义均衡的存在性和唯一性，并开发了验证工具包。

Conclusion: 框架展示了博弈论推理自然地从固定点迭代中涌现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

TL;DR: DocCHA是一个模块化框架，通过分解诊断过程为三个阶段，提升对话式健康代理的适应性和透明度，显著优于现有LLM基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式健康代理（CHAs）缺乏适应性和透明性，限制了其在临床诊断中的实际应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分为症状收集、病史获取和因果图构建三个阶段，利用可解释的置信度分数指导自适应提问。

Result: 在真实数据集上，DocCHA的诊断准确率提升5.18%，症状召回率提高30%，对话轮次仅小幅增加。

Conclusion: DocCHA为多语言和资源受限环境中的可信赖临床助手提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 传统分子动力学模拟输入文件准备过程耗时且易出错，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过集成Gemini的代码生成和迭代优化能力，结合CHARMM GUI和NAMD，实现输入文件的自动生成与优化。

Result: 该方法显著减少了准备时间，减少了人为错误，并能并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中大语言模型的应用提供了可扩展且适应性强的平台。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Conclusion: DTECT通过统一平台有效支持动态主题的跟踪和理解。

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end

insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）提升工业异常检测和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，缺乏可解释性和泛化能力，SAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAGE结合SFE和E-DPO，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。

Result: SAGE在零样本和少样本设置下表现出色。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了更精确、结构化和上下文感知的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI记忆解决方案局限于扁平化、范围狭窄的记忆组件，无法满足个性化、抽象化和可靠回忆用户信息的需求。

Method: MIRIX采用六种记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库）和多代理框架，动态协调记忆更新与检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA多模态基准测试中，MIRIX准确率比RAG基线高35%，存储需求降低99.9%；在LOCOMO长文本对话基准测试中，达到85.4%的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型LLM代理设定了新的性能标准，并通过实际应用展示了其隐私保护和实用性。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）在泛化能力上不如显式奖励模型（EX-RM），主要原因是IM-RM更依赖表面标记级线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）在泛化能力上的差异及其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM与EX-RM的差异，验证IM-RM依赖标记级线索的假设。

Result: IM-RM在标记级分布变化和分布内任务中泛化能力较差，且其表现与生成难度无关。

Conclusion: 奖励模型的设计选择对其泛化行为有显著影响，IM-RM的局限性源于其对表面线索的依赖。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在简单任务上的泛化能力仍存在问题，任务简化未必能提升性能。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

Conclusion: 多序列融合和半监督学习在数据有限的MRI应用中具有潜力，为颈动脉分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Conclusion: 研究帮助科学家根据具体需求选择合适的数据压缩和存储策略。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，GridTD在Lipschitz性质、泛化误差界限和固定点收敛方面优于现有方法，并在多个压缩成像任务中表现卓越。

Conclusion: GridTD是一种多功能且先进的压缩成像重建方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，整合多模态数据（CT、MRI、病理图像、临床数据和基因组数据）以提高透明细胞肾细胞癌（ccRCC）复发预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预后模型依赖单一数据模态，无法全面捕捉疾病复杂性，导致预测准确性不足。本研究旨在通过整合多模态数据克服这一局限。

Method: 使用CLAM处理病理图像，MeD-3D处理CT和MRI图像，MLP处理临床和基因组数据，通过早期和晚期融合策略整合多模态特征。

Result: 提出的框架能够处理不完整数据，并通过多模态数据融合提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架为ccRCC复发预测提供了更全面的解决方案，有望改善临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑血管病变对认知衰退和神经系统疾病有重要影响，但现有评估工具缺乏定量指标和标准化验证，限制了临床应用的准确性。

Method: ArteryX采用基于血管融合网络的标志点方法，高效追踪和管理血管路径，结合模拟框架进行定量特征验证。

Result: 在脑小血管病患者中验证显示，ArteryX对细微血管变化更敏感，性能优于现有半自动方法。

Conclusion: ArteryX有望成为临床工作流中的标准化工具，促进脑血管病变的早期检测和患者队列的定量比较。

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号推理与自适应控制的统一代理框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）实现故障恢复规划和连续过程控制，并通过案例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化学过程复杂性增加，劳动力短缺和复杂故障场景需要新的自动化范式。

Method: 采用有限状态机（FSMs）作为可解释的操作框架，结合LLM驱动的规划代理、模拟代理和验证-重新提示循环。

Result: 在案例1中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在180个随机生成的FSMs中实现100%有效路径成功率；案例2中，LLM控制器在非线性动态处理中表现优于传统PID控制。

Conclusion: 通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs能够统一高级符号规划和低级连续控制，为化学工程中的语言驱动自动化铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Motivation: AI模型在艺术分类中存在偏见问题，主要源于数据集不平衡，导致某些艺术风格被过度代表，影响了模型的公平性和准确性。

Method: 提出BOOST方法，通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，平衡各类别的表示，并引入新指标SODC评估偏见减少效果。

Result: BOOST方法在KaoKore和PACS数据集上表现出色，能够平衡高分类性能和公平性。

Conclusion: BOOST是一种有效的解决方案，可用于减少艺术领域AI模型的偏见，同时保持高分类性能。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Result: 研究比较了人工与机器分类新闻文章的效果，量化了文章相关性。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在稀疏数据中检测非法活动具有潜力，问题树方法能有效评估分类差异。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark

Result: 发现高效过滤输入提示和输出在计算上不可行，且外部过滤器无法完全解决安全问题。

Conclusion: 安全性需依赖LLM内部设计，而非外部过滤器；智能与判断不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Sim-to-Dec显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec框架通过结合模拟与决策优化，有效满足了供应链运输策略设计的需求。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对药物发现中的LLM应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug

control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

TL;DR: AlgEval是一个研究框架，旨在揭示LLMs学习和使用的算法，通过系统分析潜在表示、注意力和推理计算，以理解其任务解决方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注通过规模提升性能，缺乏对LLMs学习算法的理论和实证理解。

Method: 提出AlgEval框架，结合自上而下的假设和自下而上的电路级分析（如注意力模式和隐藏状态）。

Result: 案例研究表明，AlgEval能揭示LLMs的搜索算法形成和组成。

Conclusion: 系统评估LLMs的任务解决方式为理解其内部计算提供了新途径，有助于提升训练效率和设计新架构。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Motivation: 在高风险领域，错误的解释可能误导决策者，因此需要严格分析规则模型的解释问题。

Method: 开发算法分析规则模型的负面问题，如冗余和重叠。

Result: 发现广泛使用的规则学习工具会引入负面问题。

Conclusion: 规则模型的解释问题需进一步优化以避免误导。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN模型在知识图谱链接预测中表现不佳，尤其是vanilla聚合方法效果有限，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 提出Context Pooling方法，通过设计邻域精度和邻域召回率两个指标，筛选逻辑相关的邻居，生成查询特定的子图。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上应用于两种SOTA模型，42/48的测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的方法，显著提升了GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的表现。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief

uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based

sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在几何和空间推理方面的能力，特别是在处理真实世界布局时的表现。

Method: 使用符号化格式（如JSON、XML）编码室内场景，设计多样化问题类型测试度量、拓扑推理及设计约束。

Result: LLMs在浅层查询中表现良好，但在模拟物理约束、保持空间一致性或布局扰动下的泛化能力上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了当前LLMs在空间推理上的局限性，为未来语言模型在空间和几何推理方面的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Motivation: 尽管DPO在实证中表现良好，但其理论性质和内在限制尚未充分研究。本文旨在揭示DPO的敏感性和概率分配问题，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过概率演化视角分析DPO的动态特性，提出一种双层优化框架，结合监督微调和增强的DPO目标，引入正则化方案以稳定优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理和摘要任务中优于标准DPO，提高了推理准确性并更好地对齐输出分布。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，并为更可靠、可解释的语言模型对齐开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Method: 通过3D几何网格提取轮廓线，拟合抛物线曲线并计算特征参数，应用分类方法评估几何特征是否能预测缩减。

Result: 研究发现几何特征可以一定程度上区分缩减与非缩减小提琴，其中曲线开口参数最具预测性。

Conclusion: 几何分析可用于小提琴缩减分类，但需考虑缩减程度的多样性。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估仅关注技术能力或避免危害，而FAI Benchmark旨在衡量AI对人类全面繁荣的贡献。

Method: 通过1,229个主客观问题，结合专业LLM评估和几何平均评分，对28个语言模型进行测试。

Result: 最高分模型仅72/100，尤其在信仰与灵性、品德与美德、意义与目的维度表现不佳。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark为开发支持人类繁荣的AI提供了框架，对AI伦理和评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向设计和逐步推理，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的效率和性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Conclusion: 论文呼吁将自适应感知整合到实际应用中，并提出研究方向以实现可持续、鲁棒和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Conclusion: AI战略和政策需重新审视，以适应资源有限模型性能提升的趋势。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

### [177] [Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133)
*Mathieu Tuli,Kaveh Kamali,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成式全景图像拼接方法，解决了传统方法和现有生成模型在多参考图像拼接中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接方法在处理视差、光照变化等问题时效果不佳，现有生成模型难以生成大范围连贯的全景图像。

Method: 通过微调基于扩散模型的修复模型，利用多参考图像保留场景内容和布局，从单张参考图像生成无缝全景。

Result: 在图像质量和场景布局一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成无缝且视觉连贯的全景图像，忠实整合多参考图像内容。

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

*Wanhua Li,Yujie Zhao,Minghan Qin,Yang Liu,Yuanhao Cai,Chuang Gan,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LangSplatV2通过稀疏编码和高斯溅射技术，显著提升了3D语言特征的处理速度和查询精度，实现了实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LangSplat在复杂场景中语言交互应用的实时性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用稀疏编码和CUDA优化的高斯溅射技术，消除重量级解码器需求。

Result: 达到476.2 FPS的高维特征溅射和384.6 FPS的3D开放词汇查询，速度提升42倍和47倍。

Conclusion: LangSplatV2在保持或提升查询精度的同时，显著提高了处理速度，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional
feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6
FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 $\times$ speedup and a 47
$\times$ boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy.
LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into
3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with
SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for
applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,
LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even
with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this
paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the
heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2
assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary,
leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely
eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we
further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA
optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while
incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or
competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster. Codes and demos
are available at our project page: https://langsplat-v2.github.io.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适合便携设备，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamic behavior of deformable objects is crucial for creating
realistic digital worlds. While conventional simulations produce high-quality
motions, their computational costs are often prohibitive. Subspace simulation
techniques address this challenge by restricting deformations to a
lower-dimensional space, improving performance while maintaining visually
compelling results. However, even subspace methods struggle to meet the
stringent performance demands of portable devices such as virtual reality
headsets and mobile platforms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
novel subspace simulation framework powered by a neural latent-space
integrator. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning to enhance
inference stability and generalization. By operating entirely within latent
space, our method eliminates the need for full-space computations, resulting in
a highly efficient method well-suited for deployment on portable devices. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging examples involving
rods, shells, and solids, showcasing its versatility and potential for
widespread adoption.

### [181] [SD-GS: Structured Deformable 3D Gaussians for Efficient Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07465)
*Wei Yao,Shuzhao Xie,Letian Li,Weixiang Zhang,Zhixin Lai,Shiqi Dai,Ke Zhang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SD-GS是一种紧凑高效的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过可变形锚点网格和变形感知的密集化策略，显著降低了模型大小并提高了渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D高斯框架在动态场景重建中存在存储成本与复杂运动表征能力的权衡问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出可变形锚点网格作为层次化、内存高效的场景表示，并采用变形感知密集化策略优化锚点分布。

Result: 实验表明，SD-GS模型大小平均减少60%，FPS提升100%，同时保持或超越视觉质量。

Conclusion: SD-GS在计算效率和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂动态场景重建。

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

Result: 通过基于扩散模型的验证方法，展示了所提方法的优势。

Conclusion: 研究为捕获阶段内容抠图提供了实用指南和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

TL;DR: RTR-GS是一种新的逆渲染框架，能够处理任意反射属性的物体，分解BRDF和光照，并提供可信的重光照结果。

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在新视角合成中表现优异，但在处理反射物体时仍面临挑战，特别是在逆渲染和重光照方面。

Method: 结合前向渲染和延迟渲染的混合渲染模型，有效恢复几何结构并分离高频和低频外观，通过物理基础的延迟渲染分支进一步优化BRDF和光照分解。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在新视角合成、法线估计、分解和重光照方面表现优异，同时保持高效的训练和推理过程。

Conclusion: RTR-GS框架在处理反射物体和逆渲染任务中表现出色，为复杂场景的渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

TL;DR: Hi-D maps是一种新颖的多维分类数据可视化方法，通过2D多边形区域和多种视觉线索展示跨维度信息，支持交互和分层浏览。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多维数据可视化中技术稀缺的问题，提供高效且节省空间的展示方式。

Method: 将数据空间映射到2D多边形区域，通过平行于用户控制边的线分层切割，利用方向、厚度、颜色等视觉线索展示信息。

Result: Hi-D maps在多维数据可视化中表现良好，支持交互和分层浏览，但在维度过多时效果下降。

Conclusion: Hi-D maps为多维数据可视化提供了一种有效且灵活的方法，尤其适用于中等维度的数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Hi-D maps, a novel method for the visualization of
multi-dimensional categorical data. Our work addresses the scarcity of
techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective
and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D
regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel
to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension.
We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color,
countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have
added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible
exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus,
our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our
glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many
visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of
dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before
those limits are reached.

### [185] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于非可训练、确定性输入嵌入的构造性方法，替代传统的大语言模型（LLM）端到端训练范式，支持模块化组合和逐层增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型训练资源密集且缺乏灵活性，本文探索了一种更灵活、高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用固定嵌入作为通用“对接端口”，支持模块化组合（专家模型合并）和逐层增长训练。

Result: 模块化组合后的模型在MMLU等基准上表现优于专家模型；逐层训练方法稳定且深度与复杂推理能力正相关。

Conclusion: 提出了一种从端到端优化转向构造性AI开发的新范式，支持资源高效扩展和模块自由组合。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 论文提出FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型，解决时尚领域组合图像检索（CIR）中的细粒度语言理解问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法在通用领域表现良好，但在时尚领域因词汇丰富多样且缺乏大规模标注数据集而表现不佳。

Method: 构建FACap数据集（自动标注），并提出FashionBLIP-2模型（轻量适配器和多头查询-候选匹配）。

Result: FashionBLIP-2在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ基准测试中表现显著提升，尤其在细粒度文本检索中。

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型有效解决了时尚领域CIR的挑战，适用于电商等高需求场景。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化工具autoeval-dmun，用于评估扩散模型中的信息遗忘效果，利用语言模型识别潜在受损概念并生成对抗性提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器遗忘（MU）在扩散模型中难以验证信息是否完全清除及可能损害相关概念的问题。

Method: 开发autoeval-dmun工具，结合语言模型提取结构化知识，识别受损概念并生成对抗性提示。

Result: 语言模型能有效排序相关概念（与遗忘损害相关）并生成对抗性提示绕过遗忘。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为评估扩散模型遗忘效果提供了自动化解决方案，揭示了语言模型在语义排序和对抗提示生成中的作用。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP结合GNN和最短路径序列建模，高效捕捉多跳依赖关系，提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链接特定的结构模式，且现有方法计算成本高或过于简化。

Method: SP4LP先通过GNN计算节点表示，再提取最短路径并用序列模型处理，捕捉多跳关系。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最优性能，理论证明其表达能力更强。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一种高效且通用的链接预测方法，优于现有GNN和结构特征方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Motivation: 探索稀疏适配器作为参数高效模块化架构的潜力，以快速适应下游任务而无需额外微调。

Method: 提出一种简单方法训练稀疏适配器，仅训练基础神经网络的部分权重，并在20个NLP任务上测试其合并性能。

Result: 稀疏适配器在合并后表现优于LoRA和全模型合并，但在未知任务上性能仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器是模块化架构的有力候选，但需进一步研究以提升其泛化能力。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

TL;DR: Str-GCL 是一种新颖的图对比学习框架，通过一阶逻辑规则显式整合结构常识，提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图对比学习方法主要关注隐式语义关系，忽略了图中嵌入的结构常识，导致表示学习效果受限。

Method: Str-GCL 利用一阶逻辑规则表示结构常识，并通过拓扑和属性规则在不改变原图的情况下整合这些常识，同时使用表示对齐机制指导编码器。

Result: 实验表明，Str-GCL 优于现有图对比学习方法。

Conclusion: Str-GCL 为图表示学习中利用结构常识提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Conclusion: 混合物理信息模型在预测准确性和动态洞察力上优于纯解析和纯神经网络方法，支持早期预警系统和针对性防御策略的开发。

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

TL;DR: CCQ是一种针对大语言模型（LLM）的2.0-2.75位量化方法，通过硬件感知的位移编码和解码技术，显著降低推理成本，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的快速扩展，推理成本高昂成为部署的主要障碍，现有低比特量化方法在精度和效率上表现不佳。

Method: CCQ结合卷积码、混合编码和代码聚类技术，构建无查找表的编码空间，实现权重向量的线性映射，优化推理性能。

Result: 实验表明，CCQ在多种基准测试中表现优异，成功将DeepSeek-V3和ERNIE-4.5等大模型压缩至单GPU可部署规模。

Conclusion: CCQ为极低比特量化提供了高效解决方案，显著降低部署门槛，并开源了相关模型和推理引擎。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

TL;DR: G-Guard是一种基于注意力感知的GNN输入分类器，用于防御多轮越狱攻击，通过构建实体图和注意力增强机制显著提升分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易受多轮越狱攻击，现有防御方法难以应对逐渐升级的对话攻击。

Method: 提出G-Guard，通过构建实体图捕获多轮查询中的有害关键词关系，并引入注意力感知增强机制，提升分类能力。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效防御多轮越狱攻击，为LLM安全提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法通过从LLM提取文本描述来增强VLM的提示，但存在高变异性与低可靠性问题。

Method: 提出Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul)，直接蒸馏LLM知识到提示中，避免提取描述，并采用多提示加权策略。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过消除描述提取过程，提升了提示的语义丰富性和优化效率，同时通过多提示加权进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CGFM的新方法，通过结合辅助模型的输出和流匹配技术，解决了扩散模型在时间序列预测中的局限性，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在源分布僵化和采样路径有限的问题，流匹配技术虽具潜力但未充分利用先验模型的预测误差信息。

Method: CGFM扩展了流匹配，引入辅助模型的输出，构建双面条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明CGFM在时间序列预测任务中优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过利用先验模型的误差信息和灵活的路径设计，显著提升了预测性能，推动了时间序列预测方法的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Weight Sharing Attention (WSA)的新架构，用于结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，以丰富强化学习中的状态表示，并在效率和性能之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习（RL）中，如何有效结合不同预训练模型的隐藏信息仍是一个未充分研究的问题。预训练模型在多个领域取得了显著进展，但RL代理通常缺乏先验知识，需要从头学习或依赖计算成本高的基础模型。

Method: 提出Weight Sharing Attention (WSA)架构，通过注意力机制结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，形成更丰富的状态表示。

Result: 在多个Atari游戏中，WSA的性能与端到端模型相当，并研究了该方法的泛化能力及模型数量对性能的影响。

Conclusion: WSA为结合预训练模型信息提供了一种高效且性能优越的方法，展示了在RL中的潜力。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Conclusion: 组合泛化的成功与模型对任务空间覆盖的充分性密切相关，且该指标与文本到图像生成模型的组合失败相关。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Conclusion: DeCoLe为标签偏差导致的错误标注提供了有效解决方案，并可用于提升数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Result: 实验结果表明，学习的奇异子空间在下游任务（如特征分析和多步预测）中可靠且有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在可扩展性和稳定性上优于现有方法，适用于随机动力系统的Koopman算子学习。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE在校准和预测性能上优于单模型和简单集成基线。

Conclusion: MUSE通过模型多样性提升不确定性估计的可靠性，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Conclusion: 该研究为断裂力学中的机器学习方法提供了实用测试平台，并展示了数据驱动方法的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型规模扩大，注意力机制成为计算瓶颈，但缺乏对其能源和硬件资源需求的严格评估。

Method: 在GPT-2架构训练中，对八种注意力机制进行基准测试，测量训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用和功耗等指标。

Result: 优化内核实现的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention和MLA）能源效率最高，且GPU功耗低并不一定减少总能源消耗。

Conclusion: 研究强调了能源意识在注意力设计中的重要性，为选择资源高效机制提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在设计安全分布式深度学习系统时，必须考虑中间特征泄露的风险。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Conclusion: TRIP测试为排列特征重要性提供可靠性检测，适用于高维场景。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效估计数据内在维度并优化逆问题解决方案，同时揭示了网络剪枝对流形几何和重建质量的影响。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Conclusion: 离散独立性使多保真度算子学习更稳健高效，实验验证了其优势。

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布环境中模型性能、隐私保护和通信效率的平衡问题。

Method: 采用混合CNN-PQC架构、差分隐私验证精度、选择性同态加密和动态分层冻结技术。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上比Standard-FedQNN和FHE-FedQNN分别提升约25.43%和14.17%的准确率，并减少通信开销。

Conclusion: AdeptHEQ-FL为联邦学习提供了一种高效、隐私保护且资源感知的设计方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Result: 仿真显示，DPVD-MARL比独立Q学习收敛速度提升20%，最终累积奖励提高15%。

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL在集群联邦学习中高效优化资源分配和隐私保护，显著提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）的框架，用于生成隐蔽对抗攻击以规避无人机入侵检测系统（IDS），并利用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）检测此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机在民用空域的广泛应用，传统异常检测方法难以识别新型威胁，且现有方法无法区分隐蔽对抗攻击与真实异常事件。

Method: 设计了一个基于cGAN的框架，生成对抗样本以欺骗IDS，同时使用CVAE通过负对数似然检测这些攻击。

Result: 实验表明，CVAE的检测性能显著优于传统方法，能有效识别隐蔽对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 研究强调了先进概率建模在提升IDS对抗生成模型攻击能力中的重要性。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Method: 提出基于软行动者-批评家深度强化学习框架（ICM-CA），结合内在好奇心模块和交叉注意力模块，优化设备选择和模型分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，与传统SAC算法相比，收敛速度提高3倍，信息泄露减少13%。

Conclusion: ICM-CA框架有效提升隐私保护和训练效率。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在专业领域（如化学）中常生成科学上合理但事实无效的信息，即“合理性-有效性差距”。

Method: 使用Magistral Small模型，通过LoRA微调，并创建双领域数据集（涵盖分子性质和化学反应），标准化以确保质量。

Result: 微调模型在格式、化学有效性和合成可行性方面显著优于基线模型，但存在立体化学错误和知识静态限制。

Conclusion: 研究为将通用LLM转化为可靠的化学研究工具提供了可行框架，同时指出了未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Result: 在四个节点分类基准上，准确率提升高达3%。

Conclusion: 几何感知的投影增强了预测能力，同时使图表示更具可解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Result: 理论和实验证明CEBE能有效提升泛化能力，CSE在确定性控制环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: CEBE和CSE为单上下文训练提供了高效解决方案，提升了DRL的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Result: 证明了在不假设类别先验已知的情况下，PU学习所需的样本量的上下界。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了PU学习的理论框架，为更广泛的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Conclusion: GO-CBED通过目标导向和前瞻性序列规划，显著提升了实验设计的效率和效果。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research

Conclusion: ATHENA通过可解释AI驱动的子网络聚类，支持个性化干预策略，改善动脉粥样硬化疾病预测和管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal

better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

TL;DR: TLC框架通过时间滞后条件学习集体变量（CVs），以更准确地捕捉分子动力学中的慢动态行为，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀有事件（如状态转换）在分子动力学模拟中难以直接观察，现有机器学习方法未能完全编码动态细节。

Method: TLC通过时间滞后条件从生成模型中学习CVs，建模时间滞后条件分布而非静态Boltzmann分布。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide系统中，TLC在SMD和OPES任务中表现优于现有MLCV方法。

Conclusion: TLC能更有效地捕捉慢动态行为，为增强采样提供更准确的CVs。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GTED的新评估框架，用于自动将自然语言语句转化为形式化语言，并通过标准化和树编辑距离提升语义相似性评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏语义理解、计算成本高且受限于自动定理证明的进展，因此需要更鲁棒的自动化评估指标。

Method: 提出GTED框架，将形式化语句标准化为操作符树，并使用广义树编辑距离（GTED）度量语义相似性。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet基准测试中，GTED的准确性和Kappa得分均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTED为自动评估提供了更可靠的指标，代码和实验结果已开源。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Motivation: 预训练与微调方法在异构图神经网络中表现优异，但存在预训练模型与下游任务不匹配的问题，导致性能下降。提示学习方法为解决这一问题提供了新方向。

Method: 提出HGMP框架：1) 统一下游任务格式；2) 设计图级对比预训练策略；3) 引入异构图特征提示。

Conclusion: HGMP通过统一任务格式和对比预训练策略，有效解决了异构图任务中的预训练与下游任务不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

<details>

Motivation: 探索神经网络如何通过预训练任务（如下一标记预测）内在表示对数据的生成模型的信念。

Method: 通过分析不同神经网络架构（如Transformer和RNN）在预训练过程中的激活模式，研究其如何表示低维生成模型。

Result: 神经网络能够发现这些表示，而经典电路无法实现；不同架构的激活几何关系相似。

Conclusion: 神经网络在预训练中自发形成对生成模型的信念，且这种表示与架构无关。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

TL;DR: DTME-MTL是一种动态令牌调制与扩展框架，通过识别令牌空间中的梯度冲突并应用自适应解决方案，提升多任务学习性能，同时减少过拟合和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务目标差异可能导致负迁移，而现有预训练Transformer的固定结构和容量限制了适应性。动态网络架构效率低下，需改进。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，在令牌空间中识别梯度冲突并自适应调整，避免直接转换共享参数为任务特定参数，减少参数增长。

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL显著提升多任务性能，计算开销低，具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的MTL模型提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Conclusion: 通过拒绝模糊样本可提高脑机接口分类准确性，CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性量化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PVGs在非线性分类模型中具有潜力，但尚未应用于高维图像；CBMs能处理复杂数据但依赖低容量线性预测器。

Method: NCV通过概念编码将PVGs与CBMs结合，使用非线性预测器进行决策。

Result: NCV在高维复杂数据集上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器，并能减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV为实现高性能、可验证的AI提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于高维多变量时间序列，具有高效性和内存友好性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的发展，实时异常检测需求激增，传统方法难以处理高维流数据。

Method: DAD通过单次动态学习数据的相关结构，无需存储历史数据，实现高效检测。

Result: 实验表明，DAD在多种异常类型上表现优于现有方法，尤其适合高维实时数据流。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得平衡，为实时异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Result: 新方法在GPU内存不足、输入激活矩阵接近奇异或数据不足的情况下仍能稳定工作，并证明了收敛性和误差界限。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了低秩近似的数值稳定性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Method: 提出了一种与O-RAN范式对齐的框架，利用元学习优化CHO，解决资源分配和信令开销问题。

Result: 在动态信号条件下，该框架性能显著优于3GPP基准至少180%。

Conclusion: 该框架为CHO优化提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂移动网络环境。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督图域自适应方法因因果-虚假特征纠缠和全局对齐策略失败导致性能不佳，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: SLOGAN通过稀疏因果建模和动态干预机制，包括稀疏因果图构建、生成干预机制和类别自适应动态校准策略。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，SLOGAN显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过因果特征解耦和动态干预，实现了稳定的图表示迁移，提升了无监督图域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

TL;DR: TransformEEG是一种结合卷积和Transformer的混合模型，用于基于EEG数据的帕金森病检测，表现出更高的准确性和更低的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在EEG数据上泛化能力差，主要由于受试者间的高变异性。需要开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，采用深度卷积分词器生成通道特定特征，并通过自注意力层更有效地混合特征。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，TransformEEG的中位数平衡准确率为78.45%，结合数据增强和阈值校正后提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在EEG数据上实现了更一致、更可靠的帕金森病检测，显著降低了变异性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合联邦分割学习（FSL）与Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构，解决了传统联邦学习的中心化隐私风险与分割学习的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感领域实现协作机器学习需要可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。传统联邦学习依赖中心服务器，存在单点故障和隐私风险；分割学习虽保护隐私但扩展性差。

Method: 采用FSL与HLF结合的去中心化架构，利用HLF的链码协调模型分割执行和点对点聚合，通过瞬态字段和私有数据集合保护数据和模型激活的隐私。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL达到与中心化FSL相当的精度，同时减少每轮训练时间，性能测试显示区块链开销最小且精度保持。

Conclusion: HLF-FSL展示了企业级可行性，解决了隐私保护和扩展性问题。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了有限宽度全连接ReLU网络中逐层的有效维度（特征矩阵的秩），推导了随机高斯权重下隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并揭示了秩的几何衰减和振荡行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReLU网络中隐藏层激活矩阵的秩行为，以理解输入变化子空间的动态变化，补充现有关于深度网络表达性的研究。

Method: 针对固定输入批次和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并分析其几何衰减和振荡特性。

Result: 发现秩的几何衰减比为1-2/π≈0.3634，并识别出秩在特定深度达到局部峰值的现象，峰值高度约为0.79m。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层会交替压缩和部分恢复输入变化的子空间，这种现象在有限宽度网络中尤为显著，而正交权重初始化或强负斜率Leaky-ReLU可保持秩接近满秩。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联邦类增量学习（FCIL）方法FedCBDR，通过类平衡数据重放和任务感知温度缩放，解决了类不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCIL中数据重放方法因类不平衡（包括重放缓冲区内和重放与新类之间）而性能受限。

Method: FedCBDR包含全局视角数据重放模块（隐私保护下重建全局表示）和任务感知温度缩放模块（动态调整logits温度）。

Result: 实验显示FedCBDR在异构数据分布下实现类平衡采样，并在任务不平衡时提升泛化能力，Top-1准确率提高2%-15%。

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过平衡重放和动态调整温度，有效解决了FCIL中的类不平衡问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出GuardVal评估协议，动态生成和优化越狱提示，以更准确评估LLM的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以全面检测LLM的漏洞，亟需更有效的评估协议。

Method: 引入GuardVal协议，动态生成和优化越狱提示，并结合新优化方法防止停滞。

Result: 应用于多种模型（如Mistral-7b至GPT-4），揭示了不同模型的行为模式。

Conclusion: GuardVal提供了更全面的LLM安全性评估，为未来研究和模型开发提供参考。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多任务神经网络方法，用于估计随机实验中的分布处理效应（DTE），解决了传统方法在数据不平衡和计算效率上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如平均处理效应ATE）无法提供实验结果的细粒度洞察，且回归调整方法在估计DTE时面临数据不平衡和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 利用多任务神经网络估计条件结果分布，结合单调形状约束和多阈值标签学习以提高准确性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集（如节水实验和流媒体平台A/B测试）上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要详细理解处理效应异质性的现代因果推断应用提供了稳健且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为One-Point-Contraction (OPC)的机器学习遗忘算法，旨在通过深度特征遗忘解决现有方法仅表面遗忘的问题，并验证了其对抗性能恢复和数据重建攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法仅通过调整模型响应实现表面遗忘，内部表征仍保留足够信息以恢复被遗忘数据或行为，无法满足隐私、法律或伦理需求。

Method: 提出基于特征表示单点收缩的深度遗忘理论准则，并设计高效近似算法OPC，实现深度特征遗忘。

Result: 实验表明OPC在图像分类遗忘任务中不仅有效遗忘，还能抵抗性能恢复和梯度反转攻击。

Conclusion: OPC的深度特征遗忘特性提升了遗忘方法的鲁棒性，强调了改进机器学习遗忘方法的重要性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX是一种特征感知的对抗训练框架，通过自适应地为强类和弱类分配不同强度的对抗样本，减少类别间的鲁棒性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法对所有类别采用统一的训练目标，忽略了类别间脆弱性的差异，导致强类更鲁棒而弱类更易受攻击。

Method: TRIX为强类分配较弱的针对性对抗样本以促进特征多样性，为弱类分配较强的非针对性对抗样本以增强其鲁棒性，并结合每类损失权重和扰动强度调整。

Result: 实验表明，TRIX显著提高了最差类别在干净和对抗数据上的准确率，减少了类别间的鲁棒性差异，同时保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是实现公平且有效对抗防御的实用方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Conclusion: 需在策略学习中纳入动态相关的上下文信息以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Method: 提出S4T方法，通过预测跨域任务关系来同步多任务行为，结合传统TTT协议。

Result: 实验表明，S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T为多任务场景下的测试时训练提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Result: 在广泛使用的系统辨识基准上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过优化状态空间数据分布，显著提升了训练效果和模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Motivation: 传统生存预测方法依赖单一数据模态，无法充分捕捉肿瘤生物学的复杂性，因此需要一种能整合多模态数据的方法。

Method: 提出SAMVAE，一种多模态变分自编码器，通过模态特定编码器将输入映射到共享潜在空间，支持生存预测和竞争风险场景。

Result: 在两个癌症队列中验证了SAMVAE的性能，结果显示其能成功整合多模态数据，并在生存分析和竞争风险场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAMVAE为肿瘤学提供了可解释、数据驱动的生存分析框架，支持临床决策，并首次在多模态深度学习中结合竞争风险和连续时间建模。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Result: 新Lipschitz界更准确，揭示了注意力图的影响，JaSMin提升了网络鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新方法和正则化项为理解Transformer鲁棒性提供了新视角，并实际提升了性能。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary

temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

TL;DR: 提出一种新算法，通过优势函数提取可解释策略（如线性策略），同时保留专家行为的特性，适用于关键任务和现实场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习（DRL）在复杂任务中表现优异，但缺乏可解释性，限制了其在关键任务中的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在保持性能的同时提高了可解释性，适用于需要透明决策的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Motivation: 探讨预训练模型在序列决策任务中的影响，特别是如何通过模型填补缺失协变量以减少遗憾。

Method: 引入“模型弹性”概念，分析其对奖励函数的影响，并利用正交统计学习和双重稳健回归校准预训练模型。

Result: 在MAR设置下，校准预训练模型显著提高了填补协变量的质量，从而改善了遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 模型弹性可作为理解和改进预训练模型在数据驱动决策中集成的基本指标，强调了准确预训练模型的实用价值。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Motivation: 尽管自然梯度下降在实践中表现出快速收敛，但其理论收敛保证一直难以建立，尤其是在涉及凹对数似然和高斯近似的最简单情况下。

Method: 采用平方根参数化高斯协方差的方法，解决了理论收敛保证的挑战。

Result: 实验证明了自然梯度方法的有效性，并突出了其优于欧几里得或Wasserstein几何算法的优势。

Conclusion: 通过平方根参数化方法，成功为自然梯度变分高斯推断建立了收敛保证，验证了其实际效果。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）框架，通过分析中小企业的交易和社交数据，映射空间依赖关系并预测违约风险。

Result: 在真实数据集上测试，GNN在供应链分析和违约预测中的AUC分别达到0.995和0.701，优于传统方法和其他GNN基线。

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

Result: 研究揭示了DPO的通用框架，支持多种扩展（如边界和长度校正），并覆盖了现有DPO变体的范围。

Conclusion: 从理论角度理解DPO有助于避免误区，并为未来的研究和应用提供了更广泛的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

TL;DR: ApexOracle是一种AI模型，用于预测现有化合物的抗菌效力并设计新型分子，以应对新兴病原体和耐药菌株。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗生素耐药性（AMR）日益严重，现有方法无法快速识别有效分子，亟需新策略。

Method: ApexOracle结合分子特征和病原体特异性上下文，通过离散扩散语言模型和双嵌入框架整合基因组和文献数据。

Result: ApexOracle在活性预测和新型病原体适应性方面优于现有方法，并能设计高效新分子。

Conclusion: ApexOracle为应对AMR和未来传染病爆发提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data
augmentation in training machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for
binding affinity prediction. Our results show that performance gains depend
critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding
predictions without reference structures, enabling them to substitute for
experimental structures in MLSF training. Our study informs future data
augmentation strategies based on co-folding models.

TL;DR: SAMO是一种轻量级的基于全局-局部扰动的多任务优化方法，通过结合SAM（锐度感知最小化）来缓解多任务学习中的任务冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）存在任务冲突问题，限制了模型性能。SAM在MTL中表现良好，但如何结合全局和局部信息以及计算效率是其挑战。

Method: 提出SAMO方法，利用全局-局部扰动，通过仅前向传播近似局部扰动，并进行层归一化以提高效率。

Result: 在多任务基准测试中验证了SAMO的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SAMO成功解决了任务冲突问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

TL;DR: UnIT是一种轻量级方法，通过动态跳过不必要的MAC操作，实现高效推理，适用于低功耗MCU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常依赖结构化稀疏性，未能充分利用无SIMD支持设备的细粒度效率。

Method: UnIT通过输入特定的激活模式动态识别并跳过不必要的MAC操作，无需重新训练或硬件定制。

Result: 在MSP430上，UnIT减少MAC操作11.02%-82.03%，推理速度提升27.30%-84.19%，能耗降低27.33%-84.38%，精度损失仅0.48-7%。

Conclusion: UnIT证明了无结构推理时剪枝是一种可行且实用的解决方案，适用于MCU上的高效部署。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings

traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和数据管理方面的风险。现有技术通常依赖高资源和精心设计的提示词，而本文旨在开发一种更简单、更易实现的攻击方法。

Method: 基于先前工作的直觉，利用领域知识，发现电子商务平台抓取数据中的漏洞，通过模式化提示词重建图像。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了生成模型在数据隐私和版权方面的潜在风险，强调了需要更严格的数据管理和模型设计。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型依赖分词预处理，限制了端到端模型的潜力。本文旨在消除这一障碍，通过动态分块机制实现更高效的学习。

Method: 引入动态分块技术，结合分层网络（H-Net），学习内容和上下文相关的分段策略，实现端到端训练。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的Transformer，数据效率显著提升（如中文和DNA序列中提升近4倍）。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了端到端模型的潜力，尤其在分词启发式较弱的情况下表现更优，为未来模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线到在线强化学习中，如何利用离线数据提高在线学习的样本效率是一个核心挑战。

Method: Q-chunking通过在分块动作空间中直接运行强化学习，利用离线数据中的时间一致性行为进行更有效的在线探索，并使用无偏的n步备份进行更稳定的TD学习。

Result: 实验表明，Q-chunking在长视野、稀疏奖励的操纵任务中表现优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking是一种简单有效的技术，能够显著提升离线到在线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward

Motivation: 在线强化学习中，表达性策略（如扩散和流匹配策略）由于参数化复杂，梯度传播不稳定，难以直接优化价值函数。

Method: 提出EXPO算法，使用一个大型表达性基础策略（通过稳定模仿学习训练）和一个轻量级高斯编辑策略（优化动作以提升价值分布），动态选择价值最大化的动作。

Result: 在离线数据微调和在线训练中，EXPO的样本效率比现有方法平均提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: EXPO通过分离表达性策略和价值优化，有效解决了在线强化学习中表达性策略训练不稳定的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

### [271] [Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996)
*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整预训练大语言模型（LLM）架构的方法（CoLa），通过跳过或重复层来优化推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练模型是否能在不微调的情况下动态适应不同输入，以及是否所有层对简单任务都必要或对复杂任务足够。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）为每个测试样本找到最优的层组合（CoLa），支持跳过、重复或重新排序层。

Result: 发现75%的正确预测样本可通过更短的CoLa实现，60%的错误预测样本可通过优化CoLa纠正。

Conclusion: 固定架构的LLM存在局限性，动态深度调整能显著提升推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.
